Description: IronPythonMVVM
        ==============
        
        Set of helper classes for easier using MVVM pattern with WPF and IronPython.
        
        Inspired by http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvm/, but addapted to be more pythonic.
        
        Example of creating ViewModel:
        
        ```python
        from mvvm import ViewModelBase, Notifiable, command
        
        class MyViewModel(ViewModelBase):
            TextField = Notifiable()
        
            @command
            def MyCommand(self):
                # do something
                # maybe update `TestField`, event will be raise automatically
                TextField = 'some value'
        ```
        
        This view model can be used in XAML just as if `INotifyPropertyChanged`
        and `ICommand` is implemented directly.
