        Installation
        ============
        
        To install raptus.article.slider into your Plone instance, locate the file
        buildout.cfg in the root of your Plone instance directory on the file system,
        and open it in a text editor.
        
        Add the actual raptus.article.slider add-on to the "eggs" section of
        buildout.cfg. Look for the section that looks like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
        
        This section might have additional lines if you have other add-ons already
        installed. Just add the raptus.article.slider on a separate line, like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                raptus.article.slider
        
        Note that you have to run buildout like this::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Then go to the "Add-ons" control panel in Plone as an administrator, and
        install or reinstall the "raptus.article.default" product.
        
        Note that if you do not use the raptus.article.default package you have to
        include the zcml of raptus.article.slider either by adding it
        to the zcml list in your buildout or by including it in another package's
        configure.zcml.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Components
        ----------
        Navigate to the "Components" tab of your article and select one of the slider
        components and press "save and view". Note that at least one article has to be contained
        in the article in which this component is active.
