        [Mandatory]
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')

        [Optional]
        args: (a string)

        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and with values which
                 are a value of type 'str', nipype default value: {})
                Environment variables
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the interface fails to
                run
        inputMRMLFileName: (an existing file name)
                Active MRML scene that contains EMSegment algorithm parameters in the format before
                3.6.3 - please include absolute  file name in path.
        outputMRMLFileName: (a boolean or a file name)
                Write out the MRML scene after transformation to format 3.6.3 has been made. - has to be
                in the same directory as the input MRML file due to Slicer Core bug  - please include
                absolute  file name in path
        templateFlag: (a boolean)
                Set to true if the transformed mrml file should be used as template file
