        SkewT -- Atmospheric Profile Plotting and Diagnostics
        ======================================================
        
        SkewT provides a few useful tools to help with the plotting and analysis of 
        upper atmosphere data. In particular it provides some useful classes to 
        handle the awkward skew-x projection (provided by Ryan May, see notes in 
        source code and LICENSE.txt).
        
        It's most basic implementation is to read a text file of the format provided 
        by the University of Wyoming's website: 
        
        http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html
        
        Typical usage often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from skewt import SkewT
            sounding = SkewT.Sounding(filename="soundingdata.txt")
            sounding.plot_skewt()
        
        Alternatively you may input the required data fields in a dictionary. The 
        dictionary must have as a minimum the fields PRES and TEMP corresponding to 
        pressure (hPa) and temperature (deg C). Soundings will typically have a dew 
        point temperature trace and wind barbs as well, so it's best to include the 
        dewpoint temp DWPT (deg C), wind speed SKNT (knots) and wind direction in 
        degrees WDIR. Other fields may be included as per the docstring::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from skewt import SkewT
            sounding = SkewT.Sounding(data=data_dict)
            sounding.plot_skewt
        
        Sounding Files
        ==============
        The format for the sounding files is very specific (sorry). You are best off 
        using the example in "examples" as a template.
        
        Contributors
        ==============
        The initial SkewX classes were provided by a fellow called Ryan May who was 
        a student at OU. I have not made contact with Ryan other than to download 
        his scripts and modify them for my own purposes.
        
        Hamish Ramsay has promised to at least think about adding some extra 
        diagnostics.
