%%cache cell magic
==================

Defines a %%cache cell magic in the IPython notebook to cache results of long-lasting computations in a persistent pickle file. Useful when some computations in a notebook are long and you want to easily save the results in a file.

Example
-------

  * [Example notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/rossant/ipycache/master/example.ipynb).


Installation
------------

  * `pip install ipycache`
  
  
Usage
-----
  
  * In IPython:
  
        %load_ext ipycache
  
  * Then, create a cell with:
  
        %%cache mycache.pkl var1 var2
        var1 = 1
        var2 = 2

  * When you execute this cell the first time, the code is executed, and the variables `var1` and `var2` are saved in `mycache.pkl` in the current directory. When you execute this cell again, the code is skipped and the variables are loaded from the file.
  
  * Use the `--force` or `-f` option to force the cell's execution and overwrite the file.
  
  * Use the `--read` or `-r` option to prevent the cell's execution and always load the variables from the cache. An exception is raised if the file does not exist.
  
  * Use the `--cachedir` or `-d` option to specify the cache directory. You can specify a default directory in the IPython configuration file in your profile (typically in ~\.ipython\profile_default\ipython_config.py`) by adding the following line:
  
        c.CacheMagics.cachedir = "/path/to/mycache"
  
    If both a default cache directory and the `--cachedir` option are given, the latter is used.
