        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.embedder`` to the list of eggs to
           install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                sc.embedder
        
        2. If you are using Plone 4.1 you may need to extend a Dexterity known good
           set (KGS) to make sure that you get the right versions of the packages that
           make up Dexterity::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.2.1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to `sc.embedder`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
        
        	You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
        	in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Use
        ^^^
        
        Once the product is installed you will note that you are available to add a
        Embedder content type. When you attempt to add an item you will see the
        fields:
        
        - Content URL
        - Description
        - Embed html code
        - Width
        - Height
        - Player position
        - Body text
        - Alternate content
        - Image
        
        In the URL field you must put the url of you content. Like:
        
            http://vimeo.com/17914974
        
        and then click the *load* button. This will bring automatically some data of
        the element from the provider to the form. It depends on each provider what
        data it going to add. But generally the fields title, description, width,
        height and embed html fields are the one to be filled.
        
        **Note**: *Some providers only support width, height and title. So the fields
        like description or html embed code are necessarily to be filled manually.
        This information is normally encountered in the page where the url is pointing
        to*.
        
        Layout
        ^^^^^^
        With *player position* field you can set where the embed multimedia is going
        to be render regarding the body text. You have the options *top, bottom, left
        and right*.
        
        Body text will be the main information that will describe the content.
        
        The *alternate content* is to give a description or transcription to an
        individual that is no able to hear. In the layout this is hidden by default.
        There is a link called **alternate content** that will show or hide again the
        content of this field by clicking on it.
        
        The *Image* field is just to assign an image to the object that will give a
        quick visual description of the content. The idea is to show it in listing
        views or covers.
