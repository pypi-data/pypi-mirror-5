Description: jaraco.compat
        =============
        
        ``jaraco.compat`` provides forward compatibility for Python packages,
        allowing future constructs to be borrowed before they're available in
        the standard library.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Import functions from the appropriate pyXXcompat module in your python
        code. When you're eventually ready to upgrade beyond pyXX, you can
        easily locate (with a grep) and replace those functions with the
        canonical implementations.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Say you want a namedtuple (introduced in Python 2.6) in a project which
        supports Python 2.5 and greater::
        
            from py25compat import namedtuple
            MyTuple = namedtuple('MyTuple', 'a b c')
            mt = MyTuple(1,2,3)
        
        With jaraco.compat installed, this code will run on Python 2.5 and
        greater. When the project is ready to move to Python 2.6, one can easily
        grep for py25compat and make the necessary replacements with minimal
        impact on the code. In this case::
        
            from collections import namedtuple
            MyTuple = namedtuple('MyTuple', 'a b c')
            mt = MyTuple(1,2,3)
        
        Changes
        -------
        
        1.2
        ~~~
        
        * Added `py24compat.functools` with `wraps` degenerate wrapper.
        
        1.1
        ~~~
        
        * Added `py27compat.traceback` with format_exc helper (consistently returns
          unicode results).
        
        1.0
        ~~~
        
        * Adding `py26compat.subprocess.check_output`.
        
        0.9
        ~~~
        
        * Added `py31compat.collections.lru_cache` which provides a backport of the
          Python 3.2 cache of the same name.
        
        0.8
        ~~~
        
        * Added `py25compat.subprocess` with `term_proc` and `kill_proc` which
          take Popen objects and terminate and kill them respectively.
        
        0.7
        ~~~
        
        * Added `py31compat.functools`, which provides `wraps` and `update_wrapper` that
          supply the Python 3.2 __wrapped__ attribute.
        * Added `py26compat.collections`, which provides `OrderedDict` on Python 2.6
          and earlier (via the ordereddict package).
        
        0.6
        ~~~
        
        * Added py26compat.total_seconds
        * Added py24compat.partition
        
        0.5
        ~~~
        
        * Added py26compat with ``cmp_to_key``.
