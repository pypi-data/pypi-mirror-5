        Introduction
        ============
        z3c.winpdb is a trivial package that calls rpbd2.start_embedded_debugger
        when IDatabaseOpenedWithRootEvent is fired during the startup of the
        Zope / Plone instance thus making it possible to debug the running instance
        with winpdb.
        
        Two environment variables are evaluated:
        
        RPDB2_ENABLE must be set to "true" for start_embedded_debugger to be called.
        You most probably don't want this in a production environment.
        Default is "false".
        
        In RPDB2_PASSWD you can set the password needed to attach winpdb to the
        embedded debugger.
        Default is "passwd".
        
        Note
        ====
        You can't use z3c.winpdb and use python profiling concurrently, as this causes
        an infinite recursion in rpdb2's CDebuggerCoreThread.profile_recursion method.
        So if you use z3c.winpdb make sure to remove any publisher-profile-file
        directive from zope.conf file.
