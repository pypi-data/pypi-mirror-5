Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides 2 recipes for helping you manage your buildbot master and slave.
        We purposefully do not provide machinery for generating project configuration.
        
        Creating and managing your master
        =================================
        
        To create a buildbot master, add something like this to your buildout.cfg::
        
            [buildbot]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.buildbot
            cfgfile = path/to/master.cfg
            config = 
                "PORT_WEB": "8080",
        
        cfgfile is a normal buildbot master config, but it has a config object in its global namespace
        that contains the buildout managed properties set under config.
        
        This recipe will also create a wrapper for starting, stopping, reconfiguring and
        checking the configuration of the master. It will be in your buildout's bin directory and have
        the same name as your part.
        
        For buildbot 0.8.0+ installations, the recipe will create and perform migrations on your database.
        
        Mandatory Parameters
        --------------------
        
        cfgfile
            Path to a buildbot configuration file. BuildMasterConfig will already be defined, so dont redeclare it.
        
        config
            A list of buildout managed settings that are passed to the buildbot master configuration
        
        Optional Parameters
        -------------------
        
        eggs
            Any eggs that are needed for the buildbot to function. These are eggs to support your buildbot, as opposed to eggs to support the code buildbot is running for you.
        
        dburl
            A buildbot DBSpec for connecting to your buildbot database. Default is sqlite in var directory. See buildbot manual for help setting this.
        
        Creating slaves
        ===============
        
        To create a buildbot master, add something like this to your buildout cfg::
        
            [bb-slave-1]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.buildbot:slave
            basedir = ${buildout:directory}/bb-slave-1
            master-host = 10.0.2.2
            master-port = 8082
            username = blah
            password = blah
        
        This will add a slave to the bb-slave-1 directory and add a bb-slave-1 start/stop script to the bin directory.
        
        Mandatory Parameters
        --------------------
        
        basedir
            Where the slave will be created and where it stores its temporary data
        
        master-host
            The IP or hostname that a slave should connect to
        
        master-port
            The port the slave should connect to
        
        username
            A valid slave username on the master server to connect with
        
        password
            A valid slave password on the master server to connect with
