Special thanks to Alex Barnett and Timo Betcke, for their MPSPACK software.

Originally, much of the code base is based upon their project, which they have
distributed MATLAB codes for under the GPLv3. They have a fantastic design and
a well documented, maintained, and complete package, at
https://code.google.com/p/mpspack/


legendre-gauss-lobatto algorithm

Credit for the LGL algorithm goes to Greg von Winckel. Originally implemented in
MATLAB, I found the algorithm at
