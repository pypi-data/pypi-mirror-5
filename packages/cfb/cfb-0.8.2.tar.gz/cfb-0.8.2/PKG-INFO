Description: =====
        CfbIO
        =====
        
        CfbIO provides access to internal structure of Microsoft Compound File Binary
        File Format, also known as OLE2 or COM.
        
        Module operates with input file like standard IO module in Python. You can seek,
        read and maybe one day write those files, like all other file-like objects. Also
        module grants access to internal directory structure containing Entries, which
        are also standard readable/seekable objects.
        
        So, your work with this module is very simple::
        
            from cfb import CfbIO
            from cfb.directory.entry import SEEK_END
        
            doc = CfbIO("something.doc")
        
            root = doc.root
            print(root.read())  # Read whole root entry buffer
        
            some_entry = doc.directory[1].left
            some_entry.seek(100, whence=SEEK_END)
            print(some_entry.read(100))  # Read last 100 bytes from left sibling
        
        All classes are lazy, so you can read really big files without memory leaks.
        All data will be read only, when you will want it.
