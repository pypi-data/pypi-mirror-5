Description: ===================
        Borda voting system
        ===================
        
        The Borda count is a single-winner election method in which voters rank
        candidates in order of preference. The Borda count determines the winner of an
        election by giving each candidate a certain number of points corresponding to
        the position in which he or she is ranked by each voter. Once all votes have
        been counted the candidate with the most points is the winner. Because it
        sometimes elects broadly acceptable candidates, rather than those preferred by
        the majority, the Borda count is often described as a consensus-based electoral
        system, rather than a majoritarian one.
