Description: Tools to get a socketio server running on a django site quickly
        
        install in settings.py
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'socketio_server',
                ...
            )
            
        Then copy the socketio_settings.sample.py into the same dir as manage.py. 
        Change the settings to match your preference.
        
        Then run:
        
            python manage.py socketio 
            
        to turn on the socketio server. You'll probably want to create your own
        namespace to run your custom socketio logic. Look to gevent_socketio for help.
