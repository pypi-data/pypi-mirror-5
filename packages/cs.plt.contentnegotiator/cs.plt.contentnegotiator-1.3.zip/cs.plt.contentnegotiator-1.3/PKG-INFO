Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This module patches PloneLanguageTool's getContentLanguage method
        to work in a virtual hosting environment such as Plone served by Zope.
        The original code uses the variable PATH_TRANSLATED from the request
        but that variable has all the VirtualHostBase and domain keywords
        used when virtualhosting your Plone site, so this small patch looks
        at the request and if the application is run in a virtual hosted
        environment, looks at VIRTUAL_URL_PARTS variable and if not at
        PATH_TRANSLATED as usual.
        
        This error has been reported to plone-users but has no fix yet.
        
        You'll need PloneLanguageTool 2.1 to have this patch working
