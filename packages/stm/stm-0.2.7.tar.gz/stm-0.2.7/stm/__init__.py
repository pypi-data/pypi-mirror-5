A pure-Python software transactional memory system.

This module provides a software transactional memory system for Python. It
provides full support for isolated transactions, blocking, timed blocking, and
transactional invariants.

Have a look at the documentation for the atomically() function and the TVar
class. Those form the core building blocks of the STM system.

    A timer similar to threading.Timer but with a few differences:
    
        This class waits significantly longer (0.5 seconds at present) between
        checks to see if we've been canceled before we're actually supposed to
        time out. This isn't visible to transactions themselves (they always
        respond instantly to any changes that could make them complete sooner),
        but it 1: saves us a decent bit of CPU time, but 2: means that if a
        transaction resumes for a reason other than because it timed out, the
        timeout thread will hang around for up to half a second before dying.
        
        This class accepts timeouts specified in terms of the wall clock time
        (in terms of time.time()) at which the timer should go off rather than
        the number of seconds after which they should resume.
        
        This class accepts a retry event to notify instead of a function to
        call, mainly to avoid one layer of unnecessary indirection.
    
    The whole reason we're busywaiting here is because Python [versions earlier
    than 3.n, where n is a number I don't remember at the moment] don't expose
    any platform independent way of genuinely waiting with a timeout on a
    condition. I'm considering rewriting this when I get time to use an
    anonymous pipe and a call to select(), which /would/ allow this sort of
    proper blocking timeout on all platforms except Windows (and hey, who
    cares about Windows anyway?).

    transaction will be immediately aborted and automatically restarted once
    at least one of the TVars it read has been modified.
