A very minimal Mixpanel API client for python, based on mixpanel example code from:

    https://mixpanel.com/docs/integration-libraries/python

Requires `curl`, `simplejson`, and Python version 2.4 or higher.  `mixpanel-python` is intended to be simpler than https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mixpanel which has more dependencies, like `beanstalkd`

Basic Usage:

    mp = Mixpanel("your_api_key", "your_api_token") 
    # track an event
    mp.track_event("some_event", {"property": "val"})

    # import an event older than 5 days old
    mp.import_event("some_event", {"property": "val", "time": 1370740703})

    # convenience method to track or import event based on its 'time' property
    mp.track_or_import_event("some_event", {"time": 1371345364})

    # set property on a person in Mixpanel
    mp.engage_user_set("some_user_id", {"$first_name": "Pam"})


    # block until subprocess sending event to mixpanel has completed
    sp = mp.track_event("some_event", {"property": "val"})
    sp.communicate()
