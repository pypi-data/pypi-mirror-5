Description: django-board
        ============
        
        A pluggable Django app for managing board members of an
        organisation. Board members have titles, mini-biographies, and photos.
        
        Installation is simple::
        
            pip install django-board
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Add the following to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:
        
         * ``sorl.thumbnail`` (if not already present);
         * ``board``.
        
        Sync database changes, using::
        
            python manage.py syncdb
        
        django-board ships with no views, templates or URLs. To include a list
        of board members in a template, use the template tag ``board_members``::
        
        
            {% load board_tags %}
            {% board_members as members %}
        
            {% if members %}
            <ul>
              {% for member in members %}
              <li>{{ member.name }}</li>
              {% endfor %}
            </ul>
            {% endif %}
        
        
        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        You can run the test suite using::
        
            python manage.py test board
