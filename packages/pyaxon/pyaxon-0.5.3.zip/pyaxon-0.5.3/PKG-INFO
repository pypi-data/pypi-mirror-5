        ``pyaxon`` is an `MIT Licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ python library for `AXON <http://axon.intellimath.org>`_ -
        An eXtended Object Notation - simple text based format for interchanging
        objects, documents and data.
        It tries to combine the best of `JSON <http://www.json.org>`_,
        `XML <http://www.w3.org/XML/>`_ and `YAML <http://www.yaml.org>`_.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        1. Provide a simple API for loading and dumping of objects.
        2. Provide a safe loading and dumping by default.
        3. Provide unsafe loading and dumping of objects on the base of registration of factory/reduce callables.
        4. Provide a way for fully controlled by application/framework/library unsafe loading and dumping.
        5. It's reasonable fast.
