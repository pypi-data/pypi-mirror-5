        The package is given a score, based on this formula: ::
        
            Starting score                      = 0
            Has license                         + 20
            Has release files                   + 30
            Has homepage                        + 10
            Updated in last 6 months            + 15
            Has summary                         + 15
            Has description                     + 30
            Has author name or email            + 10
            Has Python classifiers              + 15
        
        Results are color coded, based on the score
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The simplest command you can run is ::
        
            healthy Flask
        
        This will check the latest version of Flask, and give you back its score.
        
        To check a specific version of a package with verbose output ::
        
            healthy Flask 0.8 -v
        
        There are 3 optional parameters ::
        
            package_version     : positional, to check the health of a specific version of a package
            -v, --verbose       : show reasons for the health scores the packages were given
            -n, --no-output     : print no output to the terminal, useful for integrating healthy with other packages
        
        
        Sample Output
