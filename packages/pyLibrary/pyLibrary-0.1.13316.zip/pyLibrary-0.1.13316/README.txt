pyLibrary
=========

A library of general functions

-  **cnv.py** - Convert between types, methods are in the form of
   ``<from_type> "2" <to_type>`` so I am better able to remember them

-  **db.py** - Simplify the MySQL client API, specifically to
   parametrize SQL easier

-  **elasticsearch.py** - Interact with Elasticsearch

-  **emailer.py** - Simple email

-  **files.py** - Default utf8, and because I can not remember the
   builtin file functions

-  **jsons.py** - Handle converting more types to JSON, switches based
   on cPython or PyPy for fastest implementation

-  **logs.py** - Exception chaining, threaded and structured logging

-  **maths.py** - Extra math functions, with proper mapping of missing
   values

-  **multiset.py** - who doesn't need a multiset?

-  **multithread.py** - optimized for symmetric multi-threading (not
   real threads, for course)

-  **multiprocess.py** - optimized for symmetric multi-processing
   (incomplete)

-  **queries/Q.py** - Named methods for very common set/list
   comprehensions

-  **queries/windows.py** - Window functions for list comprehensions

-  **randoms.py** - Because random should be easy to remember

-  **startup.py** - because application parameters should all be in one
   place and NOT HIDING IN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES!!

-  **stats.py** - Statistical functions with missing value handling

-  **strings.py** - String functions: Mostly giving familiar names to
   Python equivalent.

-  **struct.py** - Basis for proper missing-value (Null) handling on
   list comprehensions

-  **threads.py** - Because, somehow, the standard lib go it wrong

-  **timer.py** - The way timers are meant to be (using the ``with``
   clause)

Windows 7 Install Instructions
------------------------------

Python was really made for Linux, and installation will be easier there.
Technically, Python works on Windows too, but there are a few gotchas
you can avoid by following these instructions.

-  Download Python 2.7 (32bit ONLY!!! Many native libs are 32 bit)
-  Install Python at c:27 (The space in the "Program Files" may screw up
   installs of native libs)
-  Add to you path: ``c:\Python27;c:\Python27\scripts;``
-  Download ``http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py``

   ::

       CALL python distribute_setup.py
       CALL easy_install pip
       CALL easy_install virtualenv

-  Many "Python Powered" native installs require a pointer to the python
   installation, but they have no idea where to look in 64bit windows.
   You must alter the registry
   (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3652625/installing-setuptools-on-64-bit-windows):

   ::

       SET HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python\PythonCore\2.7\InstallPath = "C:\Python27"

-  Download from Github:

   ::

        git clone https://github.com/klahnakoski/pyLibrary.git

-  Download requirements:

   ::

       pip install -r requirements.txt

Optional
--------

pyLibrary does not use these, but maybe you will find them useful:

-  Install MySqldb from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/files/mysql-python/
-  Install ujson from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ujson
