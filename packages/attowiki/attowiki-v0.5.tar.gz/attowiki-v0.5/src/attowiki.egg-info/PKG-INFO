        * uses all .rst files in directory structure as "wiki" files
        * uses git for revision control

        * added 2 new directives: 'todo' and 'done'
        * some meta pages, including:
        
          * */__index__*: gives a list of all meta pages and normal pages

          * */__done__*: gives a list of all done found in all pages
