Description: 
        The xqt library is a simple wrapper system on top of the various bindings
        that Qt has for Python.  This provides a way to consolidate the differences
        between things like PyQt4, PyQt5, and PySide in a way that will allow Python
        developers to build tools and libraries that are able to work with any of the
        wrapper systems.
