Miette is a "small sweet thing" in French.

In another way, Miette is light-weight low memory usage library for
reading and, maybe converting (in future) Microsoft Office documents.

It'll be last version of Miette 1.x project. Now this project has readable
code, better exception management, but has no future in current state. I'll
try to start child project with better semantic and logic. See ya soon.

With best wishes, yours Alex Rembish.
