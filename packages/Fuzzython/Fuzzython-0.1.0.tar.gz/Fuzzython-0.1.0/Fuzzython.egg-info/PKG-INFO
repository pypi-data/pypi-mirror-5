        Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Inference Python 3 Library
        
        Fuzzython is a Python 3 library that provides the basic tools for fuzzy
        logic and fuzzy inference using Mandani, Sugeno and Tsukamoto models.
        
        Fuzzython allows you to specify inference systems in clear and intuitive way.
        Those systems can be define using an extended version of the FCL language
        (Fuzzython is compatible with FCL). Developers can also opt by describing
        the system in the Python programming language using regular sentences for
        the system rules.
        
        Fuzzython follow the Object-Oriented paradigm ensuring sustaination and extension
        of the software. The library is designed to accept easily new definitions and
        extensions of fuzzy sets, norms, defuzzify methods and inference rules,
        thereby facilitating the incorporation other inference models that could
        be attractive in the future.
