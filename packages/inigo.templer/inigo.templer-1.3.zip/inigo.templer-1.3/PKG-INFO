        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains templer templates used by Inigo Consulting as our
        standard package structure.
        
        Installation
        =============
        
        Method 1: Buildout
        -------------------
        
        Create a buildout using this configuration::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = scripts
        
          [scripts]
          recipe = zc.recipe.egg
          eggs = 
             templer.core
             inigo.templer
        
        Method 2: Install into system python
        ------------------------------------
        
        ::
        
          easy_install inigo.templer
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Instantiating template
        ----------------------
        
        ::
        
          templer inigo_plone
        
        This will create a folder with your development package.
        
        Using localcommands
        --------------------
        
        Enter your development package, and you will find a bootstrap.py and
        buildout.cfg in it. This is a pre-configured buildout which will help you in
        setting up a development environment for your package. To use localcommand, you
        will need the paster provided by this buildout. Follow these steps to build the
        buildout::
        
          python bootstrap.py
          ./bin/buildout -vvvv
        
        Once buildout is successful, you can use paster to add localcommand templates::
        
          ./bin/paster add <localcommand-template-name>

        Hacking/Contributing
        =====================
        
        Feel free to fork and modify/add functionalities and submit improvements for
        this package. It is using inigo.* namespace primarily because the template
        layout is following our internal best practices, of which might not be the 
        same as upstream Plone practices. However, we believe that some of these should
        be pushed upstream if the community want it.
