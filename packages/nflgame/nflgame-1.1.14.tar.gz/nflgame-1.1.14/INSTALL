You should now be able to run a Python interpreter and e.g., find out who

[andrew@Ocelot ~] python2
Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 24 2012, 00:00:54) 
[GCC 4.7.0 20120414 (prerelease)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import nflgame
>>> print nflgame.games(2011, 1)[0].players.passing().filter(home=True)
