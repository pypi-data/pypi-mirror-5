Description: This is a silly little module to show that it is possible to make it so that you can import a module and totally control what the resulting module is.
        
        
        
        In this case, since python doesn't have inf as a builtin:
        
        
        
        ..
        
          import inf
        
          # inf is now float("+inf")
