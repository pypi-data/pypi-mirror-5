Introduction
------------

This package provides a new Sphinx extension to embed Robot Framework test
cases and and user keywords into Sphinx documents.

The extension is not a much past *proof-of-concept* yet. Rendering of generated
documentation may still change in the future, but API should remain backwards
compatible.


Usage
-----

Add ``sphinxcontrib_robotdoc`` into the extensions list of your Sphinx
configuration (``conf.py``)::

    extensions = [
        "sphinxcontrib_robotdoc",
    ]

Embed test cases and user keywords into your documentation with the
following custom Docutils-directives::

    .. robot_tests:: Test case title or RegExp.*
       :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
       :tags: bugs, new

    .. robot_keywords:: Keyword title or RegExp.*
       :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt

Both directives (``robot_tests`` and ``robot_keywords``) take a regular
expression as their main option (or *content* in Docutils' terms) to filter
the embeded test cases or keywords found from the given ``source``-file. If
no regular expression is given, all found tests or keywords will be embedded
(like having ``.*`` as the default).

Path given to the mandatory ``source``-option must be a relative path from
the current document. (There's no support for package module paths yet.)

The test case directive (``robot_tests``) accepts also an option ``tags``,
which is optional. It should inclue a comma separated list of the tags to be
used when filtering the tests to be embedded.

Both directives take an optional ``style``-option. When ``style`` is set
to ``expanded`` the output will include headings such as the table name and
test case or keyword name.

Please, note that he documentation found from the embedded test is parsed
using Docutils, as a part of the target document. This differs from `Robot
Framework`_'s own documentation tools, which expect its own custom markup.

Experimental directives
-----------------------

``robot_source`` will embed a complete test suite or resource file with
syntax highlighting::

    .. robot_source::
       :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt

``robot_settings`` will embed a syntax highlighted settings table (with
documentation parsed as reStructuredText) for a test suite a resource file::

    .. robot_settings::
       :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt

``robot_variables`` will embed a syntax highlighted variables table (with
documentation parsed as reStructuredText) for a test suite a resource file::

    .. robot_variables::
       :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt

Also directives ``robot_settings`` and ``robot_variables`` take an optional
``style``-option. When ``style`` is set to ``expanded`` the output will the
table name.

LaTeX output
------------

LaTeX output is based on Pygments LatexFormatter, which requires custom
style definitions to be injeced into latex document preamble. That's done by
default, but when Sphinx ``latex_preamble`` setting is set manually, it
should include the following::

   from pygments.formatters import LatexFormatter

   latex_elements['latex_preamble'] = '''\
   \usepackage{fancyvrb}
   \usepackage{color}
   ''' + LatexFormatter().get_style_defs()
