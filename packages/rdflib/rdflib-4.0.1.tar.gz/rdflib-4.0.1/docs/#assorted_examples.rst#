An advantage of this approach over other methods for collapsing BNodes is that I can incrementally process new FOAF documents as they come in without having to access my ever-growing archive. Even if another "65b983bb397fb71849da910996741752ace8369b" document comes in next year, I would still give it the same stable subject URI that merges with my existing data.
