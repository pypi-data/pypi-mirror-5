python-keyutils is a set of python bindings for keyutils (available from
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/keyutils), a key management suite that
leverages the infrastructure provided by the Linux kernel for safely storing
and retrieving sensitive infromation in your programs.

The C extension module follows closely the C API (see add_key(2),
request_key(2), keyctl_read_alloc(2)).

Exceptions also follow the C API. The only notable difference is for
request_key: when the key is not present, None is returned, instead of raising
an exception (which is usually a more expensive operation).
