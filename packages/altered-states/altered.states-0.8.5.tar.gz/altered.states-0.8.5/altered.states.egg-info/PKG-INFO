        =================================
        Python monkey-patching for Humans
        =================================
        
        *Altered States* tries to take the concept of "Python for Humans"
        (http://python-for-humans.heroku.com/) to the world of monkey
        patching.

        Initial announcement:

        0.9
        ---
        
        * Added a new API entry point: `alter()`, that can be used to perform
          a two-step reversible alteration.
        
        0.8.2
        -----
        
        * Updated test suites to use `@pytest.fixture` notation for fixtures
          (now requires `py.test` > 2.3)
        * Fixes a bug causing `os.environ` not to be patchable.
        
        Fixing bug #2 means switching the `dict` -like object check from
        `isinstance(x, dict)` to `hasattr(x, '__getitem__')`. This change is
        thought to not break backwards compatibility but if you encounter
        unexpected behaviour in `dict` / `object` detection this might be
        it. I'd be very interested to know about that if you do.
        
        0.8.1
        -----
        
        * Alias `Expando` as `E` for optional terseness.
        
        0.8.0
        -----
        
        Initial release.
