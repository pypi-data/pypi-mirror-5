redomino.tokenrole
==================

This product allows you to share roles about a specific Plone content to an 
unregistered user through a link.

TokenRole use borg.localrole to assign localroles in context.

PAS Plugin which can assign localroles on a context to anonymous 
users providing a specific token is provided.

After you install redomino.tokenrole through Plone Control Panel, go to
any Plone Page and activate TokenRole support using the specific
action in the content actions menu.

A new content tab will appear to let you manage your tokens on that
page: create a new one leaving there what the system suggests or
modifying it as you need (Manager or Site Administrator role is required). Now try to access the provided url with
an unpriviledged user and you'll get the role you granted on that context.

You can manage the token role (edit, delete, modify or distribute via mail).
