Description: Overview
        ========
        
        The theme editor makes it possible to customize most aspects of a plone theme from a single location.
        After installation a new entry is added to the Plone "site setup" control panel called "Theme Editor."
        
        Using the themeeditor
        -----------------------
        
        1. Log into your Plone site as a Manager 
        2. Navigate to Site Setup
        3. Select Theme Editor

        Installation
        ============
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
         * Add ``plone.app.themeeditor`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
            
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                plone.app.themeeditor
          
          
         * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
           
           $ ./bin/buildout
                
        
        Version Notes
        ---------------------
        
        You will need to pin newer versions of plone.app.customerize and
        plone.app.jquerytools as shown below::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            versions = versions
        
            [versions]
            plone.app.jquerytools = 1.1.2
            plone.app.customerize = 1.2
        
        Important: the versions noted here were correct at the time of release (Plone 3.3.5). 
        It is likely that newer versions of Plone 3 will adopt the versions of plone.app.jquerytools
        and plone.app.customerize listed above. If your version of plone requires a newer version of 
        plone.app.jquerytools or plone.app.customerize there is no need to pin them in the 
        [versions] section.
        
        Plone Versions between 3.1.x and 3.2.x
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Versions of Plone before 3.3 do not use z3c.autoinclude so it is necessary
        to add a zcml entry in buildout
        
         * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
           
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                plone.app.themeeditor
