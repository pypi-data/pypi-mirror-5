Description: relstorage_packer
        =================
        
        Packs a ZODB in a history free PostgreSQL RelStorage with blobs in filesystem.
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This script works also for very large Relstorage ZODBs with several million 
        objects. The original pack script took several days and consumed lots of RAM.
        So there was need to accelerate the process of packing.
        
        This script does not consume relevant amounts of RAM, runs much faster  Where 
        the old took 3.5 days only for analysis it takes now about 6 hours). On 
        subsequent runs it only processes changes after last run: it considers only 
        transactions newer than last processed transaction of the prior run.
        
        At time of writing processing 44mio objects takes initially about 3-6h 
        depending on hardware and configuration of Postgresql. 
        
        The script creates an inverse object graph, this takes little extra space in DB.
        
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        At time of development the critical production environment was a postgresql 
        database running relstorage with blobs stored on a fileserver in history free
        mode. So this is implemented.
        
        I'am sure its easily possible to make this work on MySQL and Oracle too. 
        Also considering blobs inside DB is for sure possible.  
        
        I'am not sure if this way of cleanup makes sense for non-history-free mode. At 
        least it needs a lot of love and understanding of ZODB to refactor and 
        implement.
        
        Contributions are welcome!
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Create a configuration file. It is the same as used in classical pack script 
        deployed with Relstorage::
        
            <relstorage>
                create-schema false
                keep-history false
                shared-blob-dir true
                blob-dir var/blobstorage
                commit-lock-timeout 600
                <postgresql>
                    dsn dbname='test_site' host='127.0.0.1' user='zodb' password='secret'
                </postgresql>
            </relstorage>
        
        After installation a script ``relstorage_pack`` is available::
        
            Usage: relstorage_pack config_file
        
            Fast ZODB Relstorage Packer for history free PostgreSQL
            
            Options:
              -h, --help     show this help message and exit
              -i, --init     Removes all reference counts and starts from scratch.
              -v, --verbose  More verbose output, includes debug messages.
        
        When running first time with your database pass ``--init`` as parameter. This
        drops and recreates the packing table.
        
         
        Source Code
        ===========
        
        The sources are in a GIT DVCS with its main branches at 
        `github <http://github.com/bluedynamics/relstorage_packer>`_.
        
        We'd be happy to see many forks and pull-requests to make this package even 
        better.
