Description: ==========
        django-reg
        ==========
        
        *A fork of django-registration that works with Django 1.5 and Python 3.3*
        
        django-registration is a very useful package, and django-reg is a fork intended for complete compatibility with Django 1.5+ and Python 3.3. As formal django-registration releases are made on PyPI, django-reg will match them also on PyPI.
        
        INSTALLATION
        ================
        
        To install this application into your virtualenv::
        
            $ pip install django-reg
        
        USAGE
        ================
        
        Full documentation is also available online at
        https://django-registration.readthedocs.org/. The only difference is the installation is for django-reg, not django-registration.
        
        Thanks
