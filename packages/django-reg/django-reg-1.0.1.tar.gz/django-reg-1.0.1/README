django-reg
==========

*A fork of django-registration that works with Django 1.5 and Python 3.3*

django-registration is a very useful package, and django-reg is a fork intended for complete compatibility with Django 1.5+ and Python 3.3. As formal django-registration releases are made on PyPI, django-reg will match them also on PyPI.

INSTALLATION
================

To install this application into your virtualenv::

    $ pip install django-reg

USAGE
================

Full documentation is also available online at
https://django-registration.readthedocs.org/. The only difference is the installation is for django-reg, not django-registration.

Thanks

* James Bennett for the original django-registration package.
* Alex Clark for stuff.
