Description: 
        Render html stright from python without involving another language or 'engine'.
        Sometimes, you just don't want to involve these constructs just to generate some html.
        
        Note: this renderer generates ugly, invalid html. 
        It's only good for quick'n'dirty personal reporting.  
        For externally visible documents, use one of the many production worthy templating engines.
        
        ### Usage
             with r.Table():
                 for k,v in data.items():
                     with r.Tr():
                         with r.Td():
                             r.text(k)
                         with r.Td():
