Description: ======================
        Multi-Threaded IRC bot
        ======================
        
        This is a multi-threaded IRC bot that was designed to connect to
        multiple networks and load multiple modules.
        An example bot would look like::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            from __future__ import unicode_literals
        
            from mtirc import bot
            from mtirc import ettings
        
            config = settings.config
            config['nick'] = 'nick'
        
            def thing(**kw):
                if kw['text'].startswith('!whoami'):
                    kw['bot'].queue_msg(kw['channel'], 'You are {0} with the host {1}.'.format(
                        kw['sender'].nick, kw['sender'].host))
                return True
        
            config['modules']['whoami'] = thing
        
            b = bot.Bot(config)
            b.run()
        
        Features
        =========
        * Nearly every thing is configurable
        
        * Settings can be set for an individual connection or globally
        
        * Can use as many parse threads as set in config
        
        * Will attempt to reconnect if disconnected
        
        * Will disable modules after too many exceptions
        
        * More to come!
