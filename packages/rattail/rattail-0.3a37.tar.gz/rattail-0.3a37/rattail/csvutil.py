"""
``rattail.csvutil`` -- CSV File Utilities

Contains various utilities relating to CSV file processing.

.. note::
   This module is named ``csvutil`` instead of ``csv`` primarily as a
   workaround to the problem of ``PythonService.exe`` insisting on doing
   relative imports.
"""

import csv


class DictWriter(csv.DictWriter):
    """
    Convenience class which derives from the standard ``csv.DictWriter``.  This
    currently exists only to provide the :meth:`writeheader()` method.
    """

    def writeheader(self):
        """
        Provide a ``writeheader()`` method in case the ``csv`` library in use
        doesn't (i.e. for Python < 2.7).
        """

        if hasattr(csv.DictWriter, 'writeheader'):
            return csv.DictWriter.writeheader(self)
        self.writerow(self.fieldnames)
