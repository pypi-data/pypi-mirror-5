Description: # pysipgate
        
        ## What is this?
        
        This project consists of a high level Python API for the
        [http://www.sipgate.de/basic/api](Sipgate basic API) and a GUI which is based
        around a tray icon using this API.
        
        The GUI offers the following features:
        
        * initiate voice calls
        * detect phone numbers from clipboard
        * SMS functionality
        * show account balance
        
        ## Setup
        
        There is a `setup.py` for automated installation. To install `pysipgate` simply
        call:
        
            ./setup.py install --user
        
        The GUI is configured in the file `~/.pysipgate`. It should look like this:
        
            [account]
            user: thammi
            password: 123456
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use the GUI (which is based around a tray icon) simply call
        
            pysipgate
        
        There are also some command line options. You can send an SMS with one simple comand
        
            echo "Hello World!" | pysipgate --sms 49123456789
        
        To initiate a voice call from the command line run
        
           pysipgate --call 0123456789
