potools
=======

This package contains command line tools to help manage translations.

* *podiff*: Shows the differences between two po files. It only cares about the default value, msgid and msgstr, not about position in the file. You can also specify a version control repository with which to compare a file with.

* *pogetnew*: Compares two po files and return all new entries that need to be translated. Output is printed to stdout, in the format as a valid po file, so that it can be sent to translator.

* *pocheck*: Checks the pot/po file for smells. 
    * The `Translate Toolkit`_ provides a similar tool called `pofilter`_. Pocheck aims to not duplicate any of the functionality already in *pofilter*.
    
* *pounique*: Takes several po files (or directories of po files) and return one pofile (or a directory of pofiles) with unique values. It can pick the values either from the last file given, or my making a "best guess".

* *poupdate*: Will update the first po file with values from the second.

* *popopulate*: Will replace any empty messages with their Default message, if there is one, and mark it as fuzzy.
