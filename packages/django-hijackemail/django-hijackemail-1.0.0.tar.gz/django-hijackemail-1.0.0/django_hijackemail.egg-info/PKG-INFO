Description: django-hijackemail
        ==================
        
        This app fills a very specific use case: you want to test email delivery
        in a QA environment and your clients, as admins, want to receive real emails, 
        but you don't want the QA process to trigger emails to real end users. 
        
        With a couple settings, you can ensure only email to specified addresses
        will go to the original recipients, and all others will go to a catch-all
        address or domain.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pip install django-hijackemail``
        
        Add ``hijackemail`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``. In your environment's
        settings file, set your ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` to
        ``hijackemail.backends.HijackEmailBackend``.
        
        Then configure the settings below as necessary.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        HIJACK_EMAIL_BACKEND
            A string represented the dotted path to the actual
            email backend used to send messages.
            Default is ``django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend``.
        
        HIJACK_EMAIL_TRANSFORMATION
            A function which takes an email address, and returns
            a transformed version of it.
        
            The default transformation converts john.doe@example.com to
            john.doe-at-example.com@local.
        
        HIJACK_EMAIL_REPLACEMENT
            Instead of transforming the original email, just send
            all email to this address. Default is None.
        
        HIJACK_EMAIL_DOMAIN
            Use the default transformation with this catchall
            domain. Default is "local".
        
        HIJACK_EMAIL_EXCLUDE
            A list of email addresses that should not be hijacked.
            Default is empty list.
