Description: xls2db
        ======
        
        xls2db is a python program that takes an excel spreadsheet following a certain
        schema into an sqlite database that can be opened using python's sqlite3 module.
        It can also be used as a module.
        
        Why??
        -----
        
        Because fuck you, that's why.
        
        But seriously: I was getting sick of doing data entry for this toy project of
        mine using cursor.execute()'s, so I figured I'd try entering the data into an
        excel spreadsheet, converting it into the db, and then manipulating it from
        there. Crazy, I know.
        
        Usage:
        --------
        
        As a script::
        
            xls2db infile.xls outfile.db
        
        As a module::
        
            from xls2db import xls2db
            xls2db("infile.xls", "outfile.db")
