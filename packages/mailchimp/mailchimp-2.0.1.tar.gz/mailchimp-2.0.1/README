Mailchimp is a Python API client and suite of CLI-based tools for the MailChimp email service.

The API client is comprehensive, but the CLI functionality is minimal at this time.

Examples:
import mailchimp
m = mailchimp.Mailchimp('YOUR_API_KEY')
print m.users.ping()
--> "Everthing's Chimpy!"

CLI Examples:
mailchimp setup
mailchimp ping -c10
