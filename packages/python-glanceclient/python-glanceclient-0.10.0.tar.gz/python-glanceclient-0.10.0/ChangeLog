    Revert 02116565d358a4fa254217779fef82b14b38d8ca
    
    A patch slipped in that modified the default image list limit in a
    backwards-incompatible way. This change reverts that patch, but
    preserves some of the formatting improvements.

    Show a pretty progressbar when uploading and downloading an image.
    
    Add a new module that contain generic wrapper for file and iterator, which
    are used to wrap image to upload and the request body iterator in upload and
    download cases repectively, to show and advance a pretty progress bar when this
    laters are consumed, The progress bar is triggered by adding a --progress command
    line argument to commands: image-create, image-download or image-update.

    fails at printing it and exists with a UnicodeEncodedError. This patch
    encodes errors' messages using strutils before sending them to stdout.

    glanceclient.common.http.HTTPClient.get_connection_kwargs method
    explicitly sets the timeout to be a float, while struc.pack is
    still using LL as the format string which means 2 Long Integers.
    Setting format string to fL which mean a float followed by Long
    Integer.
    
    Also, Bad file descriptor error is caused by socket being closed
    to soon. Added a close() implementation to VerifiedHTTPSConnection
    which will remove reference to socket before returning call to
    base HTTPConnection.close(). This will avoid socket to be closed
    before response body is read. Socket will close when response
    close is called.

    Replace utils.ensure_(str|unicode) with strutils.safe(decode|encode)
    
    Glanceclient implemented both functions before they landed into oslo.
    Since both functions are already in oslo, it is now possible to pull
    them in.
    
    There's a small difference between glance's implementation and oslo's,
    that is the later does not convert non-str objects - int, bool - to str
    before trying to decode / encode them. This patch takes care of that
    where necessary, more precisely, while encoding headers before doing a
    new request.

    v1.images._image_meta_to_headers currently encodes headers as a way to
    ensure they're an instance of basestring. This is not necessary since
    headers will be encoded later during the request. Also, all data within
    the client should be already decoded.

    Fix problem where image data is not read from a pipe.
    
    For image-updae and image-create commands, glanceclient attempts to
    determine whether image data should be uploaded based on the presence
    of data on stdin. Unforunately it is difficult to determine if data is
    available, especially when standard in is from a pipe.
    
    This is especially problematic for update operations, where data must
    only be uploaded if the image is in queued state. For example data may
    be uploaded when the user only wants to rename an image, but the rename
    will be rejected because data cannot be uploaded to an unqueued image.
    
    This patch removes the check that attempts to determine if data is
    available to read as it didn't work for pipes. It also re-introduces a
    check for image state in the update operation, so that glanceclient only
    attempts to read data if the image being updated is in queued state.
    
    The image state check is part of the original patchset that was removed
    so the patchset could have a single focus [1]
    
    This patch also removes a test for handling empty stdin, and adds a test
    for reading stdin from a pipe.

    Prevent WantReadError when using https
    
    If the glance client is instantiated when the socket module has been
    monkey patched requests to the server can yield a WantReadError because
    the socket has been set to non-blocking but this is not being handled
    correctly. When this is the case use eventlet's GreenConnection which
    handles non-blocking sockets correctly.
    
    Also, for now, add a required getsockopt method to GreenConnection.
    This can be removed once the eventlet fix
    (https://bitbucket.org/eventlet/eventlet/commits/609f230) lands.
    
    Fixes bug 1157864.

    Report name resolution errors properly
    
    Errors in name resolution have been logged previously with the url path
    rather than the hostname. That resulted in incorrect errors like:
    
    InvalidEndpoint: Error finding address for
    /v1/images/detail?is_public=none&limit=20: [Errno -2]
    Name or service not known
    
    rather than one mentioning hostname itself. This patch changes the log
    message to fit the situation.

    Decode input and encode output
    
    Currently glanceclient doesn't support non-ASCII characters for images
    names and properties (names and values as well). This patch introduces 2
    functions (utils.py) that will help encoding and decoding strings in a
    more "secure" way.
    
    About the ensure_(str|unicode) functions:
    
        They both try to use first the encoding used in stdin (or python's
        default encoding if that's None) and fallback to utf-8 if those
        encodings fail to decode a given text.
    
    About the changes in glanceclient:
    
        The major change is that all inputs will be decoded and will kept as
        such inside the client's functions and will then be encoded before
        being printed / sent out the client.
    
        There are other small changes, all related to encoding to str,
        around in order to avoid fails during some conversions. i.e: quoting
        url encoded parameters.

    or setting to the default of '443'.

    Add image names to glance command arguments.
    
    Now a user should specify ID as an image by glance command, and I feel
    it is easy-use that a user can specify name also as an image like nova
    command(ex. "nova boot").
    
    By applying this patch, a user can specify name as image like the
    following examples:
    
    $ glance image-show cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec
    $ glance image-update --name root-fs cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec
    $ glance image-delete cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec
    $ glance image-download cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec
    $ glance member-create cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec 94b0e63a27ca43348fe056622fe3fe94
    $ glance member-delete cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec 94b0e63a27ca43348fe056622fe3fe94

    Add details to stdout error message.
    
    Current glance command does not show the details of error message.
    For example, the glance command shows HTTPBadRequest only if some
    necessary parameter is not specified.
    
     $ glance image-create --file root-fs.img --name cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec
     Request returned failure status.
     HTTPBadRequest (HTTP 400)
     $
    
    By only the above message, it is not easy that a user understand the reason
    of an error. glance-api server returns the details of reason, but glance
    command does not show it.
    
    This patch adds details, which is gotten from glance-api server, to error
    message. And a user will be able to understand the reason of a error like
    the following:
    
     $ glance image-create --file root-fs.img --name cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-uec
     Request returned failure status.

    Make image sizes more readable for humans
    
    By introducing the parameter --human-readable for several functions
    (image-list, image-show, image-update, image-create) it's possible
    to convert the size in bytes to something more readable like
    9.309MB or 1.375GB.

    Fixes Bug #1079323
    
    python-glanceclient (latest repository code) fails on Windows due to a
    malformed API url. This error is due to the usage of os.path.normpath(),
    which should not be used for URLs as it swaps "/" with "\" on Windows.
    
    The fix consists in using posixpath.normpath().

    For example:
    image-delete xxx aaa yyy will delete valid images
    xxx and yyy and print error message for invalid image
    aaa. Also with --verbose you can see some extra text
    on delete request for each image.

    Handle create/update of images with unknown size
    
    It may not be possible to know in advance the total
    size of image data which is to be uploaded, for example
    if the data is being piped to stdin.
    
    To handle this we use HTTP Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    and do not set any image size headers.
    
    Various subtly different cases needed to be handled for
    both image-create and image-update, including:
    
     * input from named pipe
     * piped input of zero size
     * regular file of zero length
    
    Fix for bug 1056220.

    Specified Content-Length in update request header
    
    While uploading a Volume to an image, the HTTPConnection's request method does
    not set the Content-Length header (since the volume file is a sym link i.e. the
    os.fstat call returns a st_size of 0). This causes Volume uploads to Glance
    fail (since the image data is ignored as no content-length is specified).
    Therefore setting the Content-Length from update( ) method if the image data is
    provided.

    * Use recursive generator function to make subsequent requests
      to the v1 detailed images resource
    * 'limit' continues to act as the absolute limit of images to return
      from a list call
    * 'page_size' indicates how many images to ask for in each subsequent
      pagination request
    * Expose --page-size through the cli
    * Convert v1 images tests to use strict url comparison
    * Drop strict_url_check from FakeAPI kwargs - now the functionality
      is always active and tests must directly match fixture urls
    * Fix bug 1024614

    Add pagination to v2 image-list
    
    * Use a recursive generator function to iterate over the image
      container. The presence of next links are indicators to
      continue pagination while their value drives the location of
      the next page.
    * A user can pass in --page-size on the command line, or page_size
      when using the controller directly, to control how many images
      are requested with each subsequent paginated request. Default page
      size is 20.
    * Add a flag (strict_url_check) for the FakeAPI class to control
      whether it chops off query params when trying to match a request
      to a fixture.
    * Related to bp glance-client-v2.

    by returning an iterator over the image body, which happens to already

    Make the read_versioninfo to match write_versioninfo.
    
    Additionally, there is an edge case where if the code is installed from a
    github zipball, versioning info is missing. Now that we're using this,
    there should be virtual no instances where a zipball will be easier or
    less cost than an sdist created tarball, all of which should be public and
    accessible, but during the transition, we need to account for the codepath.

    Support --os-endpoint-type in glanceclient.
    
    Bug: 993993
    
    * glanceclient/shellp.py
      OpenStackImagesShell.get_base_parser(): Parse --os-endpoint-type
      argument. Default to one defined in os.environ.
      OpenStackImagesShell._authenticate(): Define endpoint type based
      on command line argument. Use 'publicURL', if it's not specified
      in command line and also not defined in os.environ.
      OpenStackImagesShell.main(): Pass this value to authenticate.

    Refactor HTTPClient to use two request methods
    
    Rather than depend on magic, I would prefer that we explicitly call
    two different request methods: json_request and raw_request. The
    former will encode/decode request bodies to and from JSON, while
    the latter will not.

    Use tox for running tests locally.
    
    See: http://wiki.openstack.org/ProjectTestingInterface
    
    Tox can manage virtualenvs, and is currently doing so for running
    tests in Jenkins.  It's just as, or more, useful for running tests
    locally, so this starts the migration from the run_tests system to
    tox.  The goal is to reduce duplicate testing infrastructure, and
    get what's running locally on developer workstations as close to
    what is run by Jenkins as possible.
    
    This patch removes run_tests.py, and the scripts that manage .venv.
    It makes run_tests.sh call tox to facilitate the transition for
    developers used to typing "run_tests.sh".
    
    Developers will need tox installed on their workstations.  It can
    be installed from PyPI with "pip install tox".  run_tests.sh outputs
    those instructions if tox is not present.
    
    New facilities are available using tox directly, including:
    
      tox -e py26  # run tests under python 2.6
      tox -e py27  # run tests under python 2.7
      tox -e pep8  # run pep8 tests
      tox          # run all of the above
      tox -e venv foo  # run the command "foo" inside a virtualenv
    
    The configuration of the openstack nose plugin is removed from
    setup.cfg and added to the nosetests command line arguments in tox.
    It is used when running tox from the command line, so the enhanced,
    colorized output is visible to developers running the test suite
    locally.  However, when Jenkins runs tox, the xunit plugin will be
    used instead, providing output natively understood by jenkins which
    is much more readable in that context.

    Strip version from service catalog endpoint
    
    This client includes the API version in the URL directly where the
    former practice was to include it in the service catalog endpoint.
    This change removes the version from the last component of the
    SC endpoint (if present) for transition purposes.
    
    Note that this does not generalize to the other APIs
    where the version is not the last component of the SC endpoint.
