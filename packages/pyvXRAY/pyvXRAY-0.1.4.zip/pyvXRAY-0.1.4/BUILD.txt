
The pyvXRAY source distribution was built using the following procedure:
1. Open command prompt and go to pyvXRAY directory
2. Create cythonMods.c file: 
   $ cd cython
   $ cython cythonMods.pyx
3. Build the source distribution
   $ cd..
   $ python setup.py sdist

The pyvXRAY binary distribution was built using the following procedure:
 - For Windows 64-bit 
   $ python setup.py build_ext --compiler=msvc bdist 
 - For Windows 64-bit (using ABAQUS python 2.6)
   $ abaqus python setup.py bdist 

NOTES: 
1. Procedure for Windows 32-bit is similar, although will need to have the
   32-bit version of ABAQUS, or a stand alone version of 32-bit Python that
   uses the same module versions as ABAQUS (i.e. Python 2.6, numpy 1.4 etc) 
2. When creating binary distribution using abaqus python, the --compiler 
   option is not available. It will automatically use msvc if installed and
   give an error otherwise.
3. setup.cfg was used with the following settings:
   [install] 
   install_lib=abaqus_plugins
4. To upload to PyPi, use the following command:
   $ abaqus python setup.py sdist upload
5. For some reason, PyPi doesn't like my binary distributions. Perhaps because
   it does not use the standard install directory. Therefore, binaries are
   manually uploaded to https://code.google.com/p/pyvxray/
