The pyvXRAY source distribution was built using the following procedure:
1. Open command prompt and go to pyvXRAY directory
2. Create cythonMods.c file: 
   $ cd cython
   $ cython -a cythonMods.pyx
3. Build the source distribution
   $ cd..
   $ python setup.py sdist

The pyvXRAY binary distribution was then built using the following procedure:

   $ abaqus python setup.py bdist 

The binary distribution is made available for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows only. 
This may also be done using a stand alone Python using the following command:

   $ python setup.py bdist --compiler=msvc 
   
To do this, the stand alone Python installation must use the same Python 
and numpy versions used in ABAQUS. This is typically Python 2.6.x and numpy 1.4.x.
The mingw32 compiler (--compiler=mingw32) may also be used if using a stand alone
Python installation, but not otherwise.

NOTES: 
1. When creating binary distribution using ABAQUS Python, the --compiler 
   option is not available. It will automatically use msvc if installed and
   give an error otherwise.
2. setup.cfg was used with the following settings:
   [install] 
   install_lib=abaqus_plugins
3. To upload to PyPi, use the following command:
   $ abaqus python setup.py sdist upload
4. For some reason, PyPi doesn't like my binary distributions. Perhaps because
   it does not use the standard install directory. Therefore, binaries are
   made available at https://github.com/mhogg/pyvxray/releases
