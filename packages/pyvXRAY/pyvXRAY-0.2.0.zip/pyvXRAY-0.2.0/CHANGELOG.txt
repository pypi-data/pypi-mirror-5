
Version 0.2.0: Release date 2013-10-10
--------------------------------------
1. Added support for assembly element sets, part instance element sets and all elements
   from a part instance. Previously only part instance element sets were supported.
2. Added support for all linear and quadratic element types. Previously only C3D4 and 
   C3D10 were supported. Now C3D4, C3D4H, C3D10, C3D10H, C3D10I, C3D10M and C3D10MH are 
   all supported. 
3. Re-write of GUI. Added automatic filling of inputs and checking of inputs by the GUI
   (as opposed to the kernel). This includes auto detection of odbs in session, of element 
   sets for bone and implant, of bone density variable, of steps and of csyses.
4. Various bug fixes.
5. Updated README. Now use markdown (md), rather than txt
6. Update of setup.py so that LICENSE.txt and README.md are included in bdist (not just sdist)
7. Cleanup of redundant code
8. Tested and added support for Pillow


Version 0.1.4: Release date 2013-08-30
--------------------------------------
1. Added option for manual scaling of images. This is to allow the same scale factors to 
   be applied to different models.
2. Major re-write of cythonMods.pyx. No longer use lapack from numpy to solve system
   of linear equations, but replaced with function SolveLinearEquations that performs
   Guassian Elimination with partial pivoting. This resulted in a significant speed up
   in creation of element maps.
3. Addition of file version.py to include version information.


Version 0.1.2: Release date 2013-08-13
--------------------------------------
1. Added support for C3D4 elements


Version 0.1.1: Release date 2013-07-22
--------------------------------------
1. Bug fix. Fixed checkInputs function that was checking element types of implant even
   when showImplant was set to False


Version 0.1.0: Release date 2013-04-14
--------------------------------------
1. Functions fmin and fmax used in cythonMods.pyx. Cython module builds ok using gcc, but
   failed when using MS Visual Studio 2008, because these functions are not defined in
   MSVS 2008 file "math.h". Fix was to write own functions.
