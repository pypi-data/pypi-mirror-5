--------------------------------------

Version 0.1.1: Release date 2013-07-22
--------------------------------------
1. Bug fix. Fixed checkInputs function that was checking element types of implant even
   when showImplant was set to False

Version 0.1.0: Release date 2013-04-14
--------------------------------------
1. Functions fmin and fmax used in cythonMods.pyx. Cython module builds ok using gcc, but
   failed when using MS Visual Studio 2008, because these functions are not defined in
   MSVS 2008 file "math.h". Fix was to write own functions.
