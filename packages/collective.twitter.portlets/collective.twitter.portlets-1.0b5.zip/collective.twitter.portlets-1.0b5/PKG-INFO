        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.twitter.portlets`` to the list
           of eggs to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.twitter.portlets
        
        2. You may need to extend a five.grok known good set (KGS) to make sure that
           you get the right versions of the packages that make up five.grok::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/five.grok/1.2.0-1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.twitter.portlets`` and click the 'Activate'
        button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
