Description: # outstandingKnife
        
        ## Overview
        
        This is a simple little project which allows you to create github+pypi registered projects very very easily
        It gives you a basic framework for setting out your code complete with argument parsing and setup.py working out of the box
        
        ## Installation
        
        You should have a github account and an pypi account. Also you should install [hub](hub.github.com)
        
        Then it should be as simple as:
        
            pip install outstandingKnife
        
        ## Example usage
        
        To create a project called 'persistentIcyNeptune', go to where you usually like to develop your software and type:
        
            outstandingKnife persistentIcyNeptune -d persistentIcyNeptune
        
        OK will print more instructions as it runs. Follow these to set up the repo on github and pypi.
        
        To install your new project, cd into the persistentIcyNeptune directory and type:
        
            sudo python setup.py install --prefix=<DIRNAME> 
        
        You can omit the 'sudo' and the '--prefix=<DIRNAME>' if you want to install the project system-wide. Otherwise, provided that <DIRNAME> is in yuor $PATH, you should be good to go straight away.
