Description: tiddlywebplugins.jsonp is a subclass of the JSON serializer
        which optionally allows the JSON output from TiddlyWeb to be
        packaged as JSONP (JSON with padding). This is a method for
        getting around cross domain constraints. You should only use
        this if you know what you are doing with regard to security
        issues.
        
        To use, add 'tiddlywebplugins.jsonp' to system_plugins in tiddlywebconfig.py.
        
        When requests are made for JSON if there is a jsonp_callback
        query parameter the value of that parameter will be prepended
        to the output, with the required '(' and ')'.
