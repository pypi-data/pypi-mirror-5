Description: A backup utility for QEMU, KVM, XEN, and Virtualbox guests.
        Virt-back is a python application that uses the libvirt api to safely 
        shutdown, gzip, and restart guests.  The backup process logs to syslog
        for auditing and virt-back works great with cron for scheduling outages.
