        ============
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Design by contract is a methodology of software design. It prescribes
        that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable
        interface specifications for software components, which extend the
        ordinary definition of abstract data types with preconditions,
        postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as
        "contracts", in accordance with a conceptual metaphor with the
        conditions and obligations of business contracts.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        When using this library, just create a class and define the
        preconditions, postconditions or invariants in the method, or in a
        separate function.
        
        For ex.
        
        ::
        
                from PyContractor import PyContractor
        
                def division(self, a, b):
                    PyContractor.require(b != 0, "Divisor must be non-zero")
        
                division(2/0)
        
        This tiny library just gives you a start to know this methodology and
        it's mainly focused for educational purposes.
