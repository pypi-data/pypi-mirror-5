        SYNOPSIS
        --------
        
        ProDy is a free and open-source Python package for protein structure, dynamics,
        and sequence analysis.  It allows for comparative analysis and modeling of
        protein structural dynamics and sequence co-evolution.  Fast and flexible ProDy
        API is for interactive usage as well as application development.  ProDy also
        comes with several analysis applications and a graphical user interface for
        visual analysis.
