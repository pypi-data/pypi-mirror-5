        ============
        
        **Buildout recipe downloading, compiling and configuring uWSGI.**
        
        Creates a ``bin/`` uWSGI_ executable and ``parts`` XML configuration
        file with which you can easily launch Buildout sandboxed uWSGI_
        processes.
        
        This recipe is a fork of shaunsephton.recipe.uwsgi, in order to update
        it to work with recent versions of Buildout and UWSGI. All credits
        goes to its original authors.

        Usage
        =====
        
        Add a part to your ``buildout.cfg`` like so::
        
            [buildout]
            parts=uwsgi
        
            [uwsgi]
            recipe=infrae.uwsgi
        
        Running the buildout will download and compile uWSGI_ and add an
        executable with the same name as your part in the ``bin/``
        directory. In this case ``bin/uwsgi``. It will also create a
        ``uwsgi.xml`` configuration file in a ``parts`` directory with the
        same name as your part. In this case ``bin/uwsgi/uwsgi.xml``.
        
        This allows you to start a uWSGI_ process configured by the generated
        XML file, i.e.::
        
            $ ./bin/uwsgi --xml parts/uwsgi/uwsgi.xml
        
        The generated XML configuration includes ``pythonpath`` directives
        referencing the various Python eggs installed by Buildout allowing
        uWSGI_ to utilize them.
        
        You can specify any and all additional uWSGI_ configuration options as
        additional options of the Buildout part. For instance to specify a
        socket and module and to enable the master process add ``socket``,
        ``module`` and ``master`` options to the buildout part, i.e.::
        
            [buildout]
            parts=uwsgi
        
            [uwsgi]
            recipe=infrae.uwsgi
            socket=127.0.0.1:7001
            module=my_uwsgi_package.wsgi
            master=on
        
        
        You can also provided a set of eggs explicitly using the ``eggs``
        option, i.e.::
        
            [buildout]
            parts=uwsgi
        
            [uwsgi]
            recipe=infrae.uwsgi
            download-url=http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/uwsgi-1.4.9.tar.gz
            eggs=my_uwsgi_package

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.0 (19-08-2013)
        ----------------
        
        * Initial version as a fork of `shaunsephton.recipe.uwsgi`_. Update
          the recipe to work with recent version of uwsgi and buildout,
          improve the configuration options and prevent uwsgi to be downloaded
          and compiled each time buildout is ran.
