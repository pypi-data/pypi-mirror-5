Description: TermPy
        ======
        
        TermPy provides an interface and utilities for the manipulation of terms
        including the following
        
        An non-intrusive interface for creating, and accessing operators and children
        of terms.  This interface operates on `tuples` and `dicts` by default but can
        be easily extended to arbitrary Python objects by implementing a set of methods
        or through relatively safe monkey patching.
