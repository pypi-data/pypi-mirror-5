There are other other bindings of libdiscid available.
Please check :musicbrainz:`Libdiscid`.

In particular there is another Python binding named `python-libdiscid`_.
The main difference is, that `python-libdiscid` is released
under the Expat license and uses Cython.
This means that it needs to be compiled against libdiscid.
`Python-discid` doesn't need compilation, as it uses :mod:`ctypes`.

If you want to use the disc ID created by `python-discid` to query
MusicBrainz for metatdata, then you should use `python-musicbrainz-ngs`_.
See :ref:`fetching_metadata` for using `discid` and `musicbrainzngs` together.
