collective.editmodeswitcher
===========================

collective.editmodeswitcher allows to toggle between edit and view only mode.
This enables users with modify permissions to view a page without editable
borders.
The current setting is stored in a cookie and thus effective for multiple
page views.
This is especially useful in single sign on environments.


Install
-------

Add ``collective.editmodeswitcher`` to your buildout configuration:

.. code:: ini

    [instance]
    eggs +=
        collective.editmodeswitcher

or add it as a dependency to one of your packages.


Compatibility
-------------

Runs with `Plone <http://www.plone.org/>`_ `4.1`, `4.2` and `4.3`.


Usage
-----

For toggling the edit-mode call the view ``@@switch-editmode``.
This will toggle the edit mode and store the current edit mode status
in a cookie for further requests.

You may want to place an action somewhere for toggling the edit mode - this
integration is not done by ``collective.editmodeswitcher``.
