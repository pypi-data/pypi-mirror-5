Description: os-collect-config
        =================
        
        Collect configuration from cloud metadata sources.
        
        
        # What does it do?
        
        It collects data from defined configuration sources and runs a defined hook whenever the metadata has changed.
        
        # Usage
        
        You must define what sources to collect configuration data from in /etc/os-collect-config/sources.ini
        
        The format of this file is
        ```ini
        [default]
        command=os-refresh-config
        
        [cfn]
        metadata_url=http://192.0.2.99:8000/v1/
        access_key_id = ABCDEFGHIJLMNOP01234567890
        secret_access_key = 01234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
        path = MyResource
        stack_name = my.stack
        ```
        
        These sources will be polled and whenever any of them changes, default.command will be run. OS_CONFIG_FILES will be set in the environment as a colon (":") separated list of the current copy of each metadata source. So in the example above, "os-refresh-config" would be executed with something like this in OS_CONFIG_FILES:
        
        ```
        /var/run/os-collect-config/ec2.json:/var/run/os-collect-config/cfn.json
        ```
        
        The previous version of the metadata from a source (if available) is present at $FILENAME.last.
        
        When run without a command, the metadata sources are printed as a json document.
        
        # Quick Start
        
        sudo pip install -U git+git://github.com/stackforge/os-collect-config.git
        
        # run it on an OpenStack instance with access to ec2 metadata:
        os-collect-config
        ```
        
        That should print out a json representation of the entire ec2 metadata tree.
