Description: I heard a call:
        
            This is somewhat of a digression, but since we're in a place of mass
            renaming for most people I was wondering if there was a utility out
            there on box that would to that auto, for example, on tvt.com they
            have a utility where you select the .torrent file, select a folder,
            then the programs matches the files in the torrent to those in the
            folder by file size, (highlight those that have the same file size)
            and then gives one the option to rename them according to the names
            in the torrent, unfortunately it only works for tvt torrents. but if
            someone would like to take a look at it and perhaps tweak it i could
            upload it.
        
        so I stole part of `pyroscope <http://code.google.com/p/pyroscope/>`_
        and hacked up a simple script.
        
        I have not tested this on any .torrent/directory combinations it should
        do any renaming on, so I'm just assuming it works! No testing on
        different OSs or versions of Python, either, so don't expect much.
        
        I think it likely I'll make a super-simple gui for it, but the cli will
        remain.
        
        Name unrelated:
        `Nagi <http://myanimelist.net/character/2078/Nagi_Sanzenin>`_ is a
        character from Hayate no Gotoku.
