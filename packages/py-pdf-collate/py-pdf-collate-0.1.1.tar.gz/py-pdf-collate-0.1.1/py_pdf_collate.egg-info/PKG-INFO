Description: # py-pdf-collate
        
        py-pdf-collate is a Python script that collates your PDF documents.
        
        ## What is it used for
        Turn your single-sided scanner into a duplex!
        
        There is currently only one sorting method, but more will be added shortly.
        
        It will take the following page order:
        1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6
        And collate it to:
        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
        
        ## Installation
        1. Install ```py-pdf-collate` package:
        
            pip install py-pdf-collate
        
        2. Run on the command line:
        
            pdf_collate [filename] [output filename (optional)]
        
        If you do not provide an output filename, it will override your source file by default.
        
        ## Upcoming features
        
        I will be adding the following sort order:
        1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2
