=========

1.0.6
-----

- Adds the ability to edit the formdata of a reservation through the management
  or the report interface

- Adds the ability to define Manager Formsests which are the same as Default
  Formsets but can only be edited by someone with the appropriate permission.

  With these formsets and the ability to edit the formdata it's possible to
  create simple ways to organize reservations. A manager formset could be added
  with a checkbox "paid" for example, along a normal formset with the address.

  Each reservation will then have an address filled by the user and a "paid"-checkbox.
  The reservee cannot see or change this checkbox, but the manager can do so
  once the reservee has actually paid whatever he was supposed to.

  The initial values of those manager-only fields are defined throught the
  Dexterity-Schema editor.

- No longer compresses URI.js, fixing javascript errors in the browser
- Fixes missing translations in certain cases (locale.js is now more robust)
- Uses ajax on the monthly report to load reservation changes
