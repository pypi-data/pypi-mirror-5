= Welcome to Offtrac! =

This is the Offtrac project.  It aims to be a python based xmlrpc client 
library for trac instances.

There is the offtrac python library which offers the !TracServer class.  
This object is how one interacts with a Trac instance via xmlrpc.

If you wish to hack on offtrac, please shoot mailto:jkeating@redhat.com an 
email or find "f13" on freenode IRC.  I'd love to have the help!

To use offtrac, you can use the reference client 'fedora-hosted' in the
fedora-packager package in Fedora.

{{{
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install --skip-build
}}}

(this requires you have python-devel installed).  It will install 
the offtrac python library in your standard python library path.
