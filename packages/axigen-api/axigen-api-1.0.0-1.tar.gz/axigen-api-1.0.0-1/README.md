Axigen API Python implementation
================================

Axigen is an integrated email, calendaring & collaboration platform built on
Linux and other open source technologies.

It provides API for 3rd party apps automatization of processes, but pitfully
Axigen's parent company provides library only for PHP usage.

Due to requirements of one of the clients we have written the API library
for managing Axigen resources from Python code.

Warning
-------

This is an *incomplete* API implementation. If you require more Axigen
functionality implemented, you can either contact me to extend this API
for your needs (our client needed only the features given in this code),
or you feel free to extend the library yourself.
