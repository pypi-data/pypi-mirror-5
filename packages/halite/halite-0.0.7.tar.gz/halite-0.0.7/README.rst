======
Halite
======

(Code-name) Halite is a Salt GUI. Status is pre-alpha. Contributions are
very welcome. Join us in #salt-devel on Freenode or on the salt-users mailing
list.

This is version 0.0.3 which is substantially changed from the previous version.
Any application based on the previous version will be broken.

This version is substantially different. Notable changes include:
1. Use of a new unified api in salt/client/api.py for talking to salt.
Does not use Salt-API. The rest service is integral to halite.

2. Use of Server Sent Events (SSE) to receive realtime streaming of events 
from the Salt Event Bus.

3. Use of Bottle web framework included with choice of WSGI web servers. The server must
be multithreaded or gevented or the equivalent in order to support SSE. The tested
servers are paste, cherrypy, and gevent

4. Simplified web API that is a thin wrapper around salt/client/api.py

This version of Halite is meant to work out of the box with an install option for 
SaltStack. The PyPi  (PIP) version of Halite is a minified version that is meant
to be installed along side Salt to provide a minimal out of the box UI for Salt.

The repository is meant for development of custom versions of the UI that would
be deployed with different servers, different configurations, etc and for development
of future features for the Salt packaged version.

Installation quickstart
=======================

1. Setup permissions for users who will use Halite
For example in master config:
  
.. code-block:: bash  
  saltwui:
      - .*
      - '@runner'
      - '@wheel'

  Halite uses the runner manage.status to get the status of minions so runner
  permissions are required.  Currently halite allows but does not require any 
  wheel modules.

2.  Clone the Halite repository::

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/saltstack/halite


3. Run halite/halite/server_bottle.py (use with -h option to get parameters)
   The simplest approach is to run the server with it dynamically generating
   the main web app load page (main.html) in coffescript mode, where the coffeescript
   is transpiled to javascript on the fly. In each case the appropriate server package
   must be installed.
   
.. code-block:: bash
  
    $ ./server_bottle.py -d -C -l debug -s cherrypy
    
    $ ./server_bottle.py -d -C -l debug -s paste

    $ ./server_bottle.py -d -C -l debug -s gevent
    


4. Navigate html5 compliant browser to http://localhost:8080/app

6. Login

The default eauth method is 'pam'. To change go to the preferences page.

Documentation
=============

Preferences
-----------

Click on the SaltStack logo to go to the preferences page

On this page one can change the eauth method to something other than 'pam' such
as 'ldap'.
Enter the new eauth method string into the field saltApi.eauth and hit update.
Now refresh the browser page and the new eauth method will be enabled. Login.
