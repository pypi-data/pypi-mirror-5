        Introduction
        ============
        
        This product is a simple Faq content type for Plone. It provides the
        following features:
        
         * Two new types, FaqFolder and FaqEntry. FaqFolder can contain FaqEntry and
           FaqFolder to create categories of questions.
         * Questions are collapsable in the FaqEntry's view to show or hide answers.
         * A delay can be specified to marked recent questions as new (display of a
           small icon before titles).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You install it the usual way - Add the product to your buildout and install
        it via the Plone controlpanel
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
         * Plone 4.0 or later (probably it works with Plone 3 but was not tested)
         * for running the tests plone.app.testing is needed.
