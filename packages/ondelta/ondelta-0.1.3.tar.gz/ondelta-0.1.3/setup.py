    Utility function to read the README file.
    Used for the long_description.  It's nice, because now 1) we have a top level
    README file and 2) it's easier to type in the README file than to put a raw
    string in below ...

    Wrapping this in a try block because it appears that IOErrors are being throw due to README.md not making its way to pypi
