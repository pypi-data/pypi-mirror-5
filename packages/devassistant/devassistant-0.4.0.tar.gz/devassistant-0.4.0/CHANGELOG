- Introduction of "preparer" assistants (use devassitant-prepare binary) that
  can checkout project from SCM and install it's dependencies according to
  .devassistant file
- Perl assistants, PHP assistant
- New way of dependency installation (first find dependencies via yum api,
  then show them to user and let him confirm, then install)
- Interactive commands now use zenity, if available, otherwise they fall
  back to terminal.
- New style of calling assistant/snippet sections
  (call: snippet.section; call: self.run_foo)
- Support for using SCLs easily (the "scl enable" command in yaml assistants)
- GitHub backend rewrite (can now create ssh keys and add them to the user,
  remembers authentication token)
- Some minor/less visible changes (logging improvement, bugfixing, cleanup)
