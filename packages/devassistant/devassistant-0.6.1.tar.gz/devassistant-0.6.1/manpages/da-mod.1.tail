.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Developer assistant
is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure like this:

                  MainAssistant
                  /           \\
                 /             \\
              Python          Ruby
              /   \\            / \\
             /     \\          /   \\
          Django  Flask    Rails Sinatra

The basic task of each modifier assistant is to modify a project in location specified by
.B -p path
(defaults to current working directory if not specified) and install dependencies via \fBYum\fP.
Optionally, if any environment setup is required,
.B devassistant-modify
does that as well.
Most of the assistants have common arguments (see below), but there may also be some specific options in some of the assistants.
