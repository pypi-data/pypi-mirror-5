There are three assistant roles:

creator
  creates new projects
modifier
  modifies existing projects
preparer
  prepares environment for development of upstream project or custom task

The main purpose of having roles is separating different types of tasks.
It would be confusing to have e.g. ``python django`` assistant (that
creates new project) side-by-side with ``eclipse`` assistant (that registers
existing project into Eclipse).
