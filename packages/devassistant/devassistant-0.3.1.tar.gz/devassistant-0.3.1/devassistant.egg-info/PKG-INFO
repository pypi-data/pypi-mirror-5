Description: devassistant
        ============
        
        Developer Assistant - start developing with ease.
        
        The devassistant project is a helper for all developers using (not-only) Fedora. It helps with creating and setting up basic projects in various languages, installing dependencies, setting up environment etc.
        
        Devassistant is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure. E.g. you can run:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ devassistant python django -n ~/myproject # sets up Django project named "myproject" inside your home dir
          $ devassistant python flask -n ~/flaskproject # sets up Flask project named "flaskproject" inside your home dir
          $ devassistant java jsf -n ~/alsomyproject # sets up RoR project named "alsomyproject" inside your home dir
        
        There is also a possibity to modify a project that was previously created by Devassistant. Currently, adding to eclipse is the only assistant that works with existing projects:
        
        .. code:: sh
          $ devassistant-modify eclipse # run in project dir or use -p to specify path
        
        Devassistant works on Python 2.6, 2.7 and >= 3.3.
