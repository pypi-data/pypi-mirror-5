.SH SUDOERS CHANGES
For right
.B developer assistant
functionality user has to be added to sudoers file. This is needs because developer assistant can install additional packages which are needed by assistants.

This can be done so that user will switch to user root (by \fBsu -\fP command) and write down command visudo.

Following row has to be added at the end of that file

<user_name> ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/yum, /usr/bin/yum-builddep

user_name ... is not \fBroot\fP but real username which will run devassistant (can be obtained by command \fBid\fP).

.SH GITHUB INTEGRATION
If github option is used for export projects to the GitHub repository then
user has to have already created account on the GitHub server.
Without that it is not possible to upload projects on the GitHub server

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Developer assistant
is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure like this:

                  MainAssistant
                  /           \\
                 /             \\
              Python          Ruby
              /   \\            / \\
             /     \\          /   \\
          Django  Flask    Rails Sinatra

The basic task of each assistant is to create a project in location specified by
.B -n name
(either relative or absolute path) and install its dependencies via \fBYum\fP.
Optionally, if any environment setup is required,
.B devassistant
does that as well.
Most of the assistants have common arguments (see below), but there may also be some language specific options in some of the assistants.

.SH LANGUAGE SUPPORT
Currently supported languages are:
.IP
C/C++ language
