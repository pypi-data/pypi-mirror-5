        Devassistant project is a helper for all developers using (not-only) Fedora. It helps with creating and setting up basic projects in various languages, installing dependencies, setting up environment etc.
        
        Devassistant is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure. E.g. you can run:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ da python django -n ~/myproject # sets up Django project named "myproject" inside your home dir
          $ da python flask -n ~/flaskproject # sets up Flask project named "flaskproject" inside your home dir
          $ da java jsf -n ~/alsomyproject # sets up RoR project named "alsomyproject" inside your home dir
        
        Devassistant also allows you to work with a previously created project, for example import it to Eclipse:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ da-mod eclipse # run in project dir or use -p to specify path
        
        Last but not least, devassistant allows you to prepare environment for executing arbitrary tasks or developing upstream projects (either using "custom" assistant for projects previously created by devassistant or using specific assistant for specific projects):
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ da-prep custom -u scm_url -p directory_to_save_to
        
        For full documentation, see https://developer-assistant.readthedocs.org/
        
        Devassistant works on Python 2.6, 2.7 and >= 3.3.
