Description: World modern and historical timezone definitions, implemented as
        Python tzinfo subclasses suitable for use my Python's datetime module.
        Timezone information was provided by the Olsen Timezone database.
        Using these timezone definitions resolves all ambiguous daylight savings
        time transitions. All DST trantions have been tested against the reference
        implementation of zdump found in the Olsen database to confirm even
        the obscure historical cases work. This test suite is available seperatly
        as it is rather large (75558 comparisisons), as is the program used
        to generate this package.
        
        The Olsen Timezone database is updated roughly four times per year,
        usually with obscure and generally unnoticable changes. These files
        will be regenerated and rereleased soon after updated editions of the
        Olsen database are made available.
