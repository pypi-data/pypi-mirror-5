========

This library packages the `Pure CSS <http://purecss.io/>`_ library for `Fanstatic <http://www.fanstatic.org>`_.

This requires integration between your web framework and fanstatic, and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the resources directory in css.pure) are published to some URL.
