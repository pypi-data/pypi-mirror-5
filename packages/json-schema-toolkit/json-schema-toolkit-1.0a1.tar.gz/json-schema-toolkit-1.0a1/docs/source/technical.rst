Technical and Implementation Notes
==================================

================
Deleting Members
================

Deleting a value is implemented through setting the value of a DocumentFragment.
This is done so the Document can keep track of fragments in its cache, as well
as bump its revision.


=================
Schema dictionary
=================

The schema generated by a JSONDocumentField records all arguments passed to the
constructor of the field, as well as a reference to itself through '__field', in
a similar way that the fragment implementation class is recorded in
'__fragment_cls'.
