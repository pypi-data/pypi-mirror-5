Welcome to JSON Schema Toolkit's documentation!
===============================================

Programmatic building of JSON schemas (recursive field mappings) with
validation, a Django JSON Field, and native PostgreSQL JSON type constraints.


=============================
Overview
=============================

Built on top of `json_document <https://github.com/zyga/json-document/>`_ and
`json_schema_validator <https://github.com/zyga/json-schema-validator/>`_, with
powerful support for building and validating JSON documents. Can be used to
programmatically build JSON schemas by mapping fields to a document or
recursively to other fields, as well as used for validating a Django JSON field
during save operations. If PostgreSQL >= 9.2 is used, supports the native JSON
data type. If PostgreSQL >= 9.3 is used, supports custom JSON SQL constraint
generation for the Django Model.

Extends json_document to provide nullable fields (in additional to optional
fields), deletion of members (through del), a Pythonic API for dot notation
member access, as well as convenience input transformations for data such as
dates and times, time deltas, and others.
