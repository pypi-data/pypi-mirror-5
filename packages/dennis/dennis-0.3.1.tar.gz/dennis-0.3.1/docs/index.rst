dennis is a command line tool for translating and linting .po files.

It includes the following subcommands:

* **translate**: Translates strings in ``.po`` files into something
  else!  Comes with an HTML extractor (tokenizes strings so that only
  the text is translated) and a Pirate! translation. This is helpful
  for l10n testing, development, finding unicode/layout problems,
  amazing your friends, hilarious April 1st shenanigans, etc.

  The system allows for other translators and extractors using a
  loosely coupled pipeline.

  This also works on strings passed in as command line arguments and
  as stdin---it doesn't have to be a ``.po`` file or in a ``.po``
  format.

* **lint**: Lints ``.po`` files for cases where there are variable
  formatting tokens in msg strings that aren't in the translated
  strings and vice versa.

  The system allows for defining other variable formats.
