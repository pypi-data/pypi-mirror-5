    Pulls the starting and stopping frames for epochs defined in a logstream.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    stream : Element
       sliced to just the row you are interested in
    
    Returns
    -------
    fsdict : dict
        dict of FrameSlice instances

    FrameSlice
    
    Notes
    -----    
    Ignores epoch with a state of 0.
    
    Assumes that each epoch only occurs once. Raises RuntimeError if a 
    non-zero  epoch state occurs more than once.
