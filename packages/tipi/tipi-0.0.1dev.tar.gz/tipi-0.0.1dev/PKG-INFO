        Status: ACTIVE
        --------------
        
        Under active development and maintenance.
        
        Ideas behind this project
        -------------------------
        
        - Input is HTML code, output is the same HTML code with changes in typography (entities, spaces, quotes, etc.).
        - `You can't parse HTML with regex. <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/325365>`_
        - The best existing HTML parser and *tokenizer* for Python is `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_.
        - There are more languages than English in the world. Each of them has different typographic rules.
        
        Alternatives
        ------------
        
        - `Typogrify <https://github.com/mintchaos/typogrify>`_ - English only, adds markup for styling, on top of `smartypants <http://web.chad.org/projects/smartypants.py/>`_
        - `cstypo <https://github.com/yetty/cstypo>`_ - Czech only, not working well with HTML
        
        Plans
        -----
        
        - Inspiration from `Typogrify <http://static.mintchaos.com/projects/typogrify/>`_?
        - Get some inspiration from `Texy! <https://github.com/dg/texy/blob/master/Texy/modules/TexyTypographyModule.php>`_
        - Get some inspiration from `Dero's <http://typografie.dero.name/typografie-entity.php>`_ and `Typomil's <http://typomil.com/typografie-na-webu/znakove-entity.htm>`_ typography guides.
        - Get some inspiration from `Liteera.cz <http://www.liteera.cz/>`_) (`source <https://is.muni.cz/auth/th/172528/fi_b?info=1;zpet=%2Fauth%2Fvyhledavani%2F%3Fsearch%3Djakub%20fiala%26start%3D1>`_).
        - Maybe also some inspiration `from here <http://www.webtvorba.cz/web/typografie-na-webu.html>`_.
        - `Texy! rules extracted to RegExps <https://gist.github.com/msgre/3805872>`_.
        - `Texy! tests <https://github.com/dg/texy/tree/release-2.x/tests/Texy>`_.
