Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        seantis.dir.base allows to put dexterity objects into 1-4 categories, showing those categories in a browsable and searchable catalog.
        
        The idea of this plone module is to provide all basic functionality needed to categorize, search and filter objects. These objects may be extended with custom fields using dexterity.
        
        An example, offering a directory of contacts can be found here: https://github.com/seantis/seantis.dir.contacts
        
        This module is probably only really useful for anyone if used as a base to build on. By itself it only offers the categorization and search functionalities.

        Installation
        ============
        
        1. Add dexterity to Plone by adding the following Known Good Set to your buildout.cfg::
        
            extends =
                ...
                http://dist.plone.org/release/4.2/versions.cfg
        
        2. Add the module to your instance eggs::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                seantis.dir.base
        
        
        3. Ensure that the i18n files are compiled by adding::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            environment-vars = 
                ...
                zope_i18n_compile_mo_files true
        
        4. Install seantis.dir.base using portal_quickinstaller

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.4.1
        -----
        - Provide better default template for result list entry
        - Provide a macro for default directory information
        - Fixes search viewlet being hidden on item view
        - New flag allow_custom_categories on directory which can be used to prevent users
        from entering their own categories on items
        
        1.4
        ---
        - Map markers macro is now compatible with both brains and actual objects
        - Requires Plone 4.3 to run
        
        1.3
        ---
        - Map markers are now always set in the order of the itemview's batch list.
        - The directory no longer uses a homegrown getObject cache and will instead
          use catalog brains as much as possible. Directories building on
          seantis.dir.base might have taken that for granted, so they might be
          incompatible with this version.
        
          As a result, viewlets registered with the DirectoryItemViewletManager now
          need to expect catalog brains instead of objects.
        
          The upsides are big performance gains and more stability.
