Description: # memprof
        
        `memprof` is a memory profiler for Python. 
        
        It logs and plots the memory usage of all the variables during the execution of the decorated methods.
        
        ## Installation
        ### Stable
            sudo pip install --upgrade memprof
            
        or
        
            sudo easy_install --upgrade memprof
            
        ### Development
            
            git clone git://github.com/jmdana/memprof.git
            cd memprof
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        ## Usage
        
        Using `memprof` is as easy as adding a decorator to the methods that you want to profile:
        
            @memprof
            def foo():
            
        And importing the module just by including the line below at the beginning of your Python file:
        
            from memprof import *
        
        Now you can run as usual and logfiles with the names of your methods will be created (e.g. `foo.log`).
        
        ### Generating plots
        
        The logfiles are not very interesting so you might prefer to use the `-p`/`--plot` flag:
            
            python -m memprof --plot <python_file>
            python -m memprof -p <python_file>
            
        Which, in addition to the logfile, will generate a plot (`foo.png`):
        
        ![Image](examples/foo.png)
        
        The grey bar indicates that the `foo` method wasn't running at that point.
        
        The flag may also be passed as an argument to the decorator:
        
            @memprof(plot = True)
        
        Please keep in mind that the former takes precedence over the latter.
        
        ### Adjusting the threshold
        
        You may also want to specify a `threshold`. The value will be the minimum size for a variable to appear in the plot (but it will always appear in the logfile!). The default value is 1048576 (1 MB) but you can specify a different `threshold` (in bytes) with the `-t`/`--threshold` flag:
        
            python -m memprof --threshold 1024 <python_file>
            python -m memprof -t 1024 <python_file>
            
        The `threshold` may also be passed as an argument to the decorator:
        
            @memprof(threshold = 1024)
        
        Please keep in mind that the former takes precedence over the latter.    
        
        ### mp_plot 
        
        If, after running `memprof`, you want to change the threshold and generate a new plot (or you forgot to use the `-p`/`--plot` flag with `memprof`), you don't have to re-run! Just call the command:
            
            mp_plot [-h] [-t THRESHOLD] logfiles [logfiles ...]
            
        and generate the plots again doing something like:
        
            mp_plot -t 128 logfile1.log logfile2.log
            
        or:
         
            mp_plot -t 1024 *.log
            
        etc.
