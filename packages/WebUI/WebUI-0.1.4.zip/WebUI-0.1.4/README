WebUI
=====

WebUI is a Python module that allows you to convert Flask apps into cross platform desktop apps with three lines of code.

Installation:
-------
```
easy_install pyside # Windows only, as pip does not install binaries  
pip install WebUI
```

Usage:
------
```
from WebUI import WebUI # Add WebUI to your imports
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
...

app = Flask(__name__)
ui = WebUI(app, debug=True) # Create a WebUI instance

... # all of your standard flask logic

if __name__ == '__main__':
  ui.run() #replace app.run() with ui.run(), and that's it
```

WebUI is powered by PySide, and should run on Windows, Mac and Linux. You can even create standalone executables using PyInstaller!
