Description: flashcachegroup (fcg)
        ===================
        
        making fb's flashcache to cache a group of disks with one or multiple SSDs.
        
        Fcg allows admins to dynamically create groups of hard disks, and 
        apply caching on the group instead of each individual disk.

        ====================
        
        Modules
        --------
        * flashcache

            sudo pip install flashcachegroup
        
        Or manually (assuming all required modules are installed on your system)::
