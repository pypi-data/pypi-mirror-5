1.0.2 (2011-11-14)
------------------

* Set the icon_expr in actions.xml so we register the action icon in
  the preferred way in Plone 4.  We keep actionicons.xml for backwards
  compatibility with Plone 3.
  [maurits]

* No longer use the plone domain for our action as portal_actions
  accepts other domains too.  This means we no longer need the i18n
  directory.  Added an upgrade step to switch our action to use
  collective.sortmyfolder as domain.
  [maurits]

  (automatically when using zest.releaser+zest.pocompile).
