Introduction
============

This package implements the *Explore* portlet for Plone 3: a navigation
menu which supports expand/collapse. 

This portlet uses jQuery live events, which were added in jQuery 1.3. If you
use an older version of jQuery this portlet will not work.

Plone versions up to 3.3rc2 include jQuery 1.2, so if you use those you will
need to manually update the `jquery.js` file shipped with Plone. Plone 3.3rc3
and later already include jQuery 1.3.
