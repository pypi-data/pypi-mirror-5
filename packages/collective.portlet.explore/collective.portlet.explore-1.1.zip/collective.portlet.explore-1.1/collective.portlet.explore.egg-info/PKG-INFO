Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package implements the *Explore* portlet for Plone 3: a navigation
        menu which supports expand/collapse. 
        
        This portlet uses jQuery live events, which were added in jQuery 1.3. If you
        use an older version of jQuery this portlet will not work.
        
        Plone versions up to 3.3rc2 include jQuery 1.2, so if you use those you will
        need to manually update the `jquery.js` file shipped with Plone. Plone 3.3rc3
        and later already include jQuery 1.3.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1 - June 19, 2013
        -------------------
        
        - Added Dutch translation [kysr]
        
        - Added conditional include of CMFCore permisssions.zcml for Plone 4.1 support
          [rbeylerian]
        
        - Fix JS regex to match UIDs with dashes in them [jcbrand]
        
        - Fix the NavtreeStrategy to derive from NavtreeStrategyBase in order to have
          a default supplimentQuery [tiazma]
          
        1.0 - June 23, 2011
        -------------------
        
        - Document the jQuery 1.3 dependency [wichert]
        
        - Plone 4 compatible, fixes #10 [ida]
        
        
        1.0rc3 - July 3, 2009
        ---------------------
        
        - Rewrite to use pure jQuery instead of KSS. This reduces page load time
          by multiple seconds for non-trivial navigation trees on older browsers.

        1.0rc2 - March 16, 2009
        -----------------------
        
        - Add HTTPCache statement for twistie images.
          [wichert]
        
        - Update navigation tree for PLIP 126 merge.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0rc1 - April 24, 2008
        -----------------------
        
        - Explicitly disable event bubbling for twistie clicks. This is not an issue
          for the standard markup, but makes things easier for customizations which
          put the twistie inside an anchor.
          [wichert]
        
        - Correctly set the CSS class for the twistie for already opened folders
          to expandedNode.
          [wichert]
        
        - Rename local kss module to browser to prevent conflicts with top level
          kss.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0b1 - March 6, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        - First release
