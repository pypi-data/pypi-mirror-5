Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This library provides a Python wrapper for Veracity's command-line interface.
        It includes objects for repositories, working copies, and other commonly-used
        items. The library also provides command-line tools to work with Veracity's
        distributed build tracking features.

            from veracity import Repository, WorkingCopy
        
            # Clone a repo
            repo = Repository('veracity', remote='http://public.veracity-scm.com/repos/veracity')
        
            # Check out a working copy (from repo)
            work = repo.checkout("v/veracity")
        
            # Check out a working copy (by repo)
            work2 = WorkingCopy("v/veracity2", repo='veracity')
            work2.update(branch='onveracity')
