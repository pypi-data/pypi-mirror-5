        ============================================
        
        Xnet is a framework and a collection of command-line
        tools utilizing microthreads (from the python library gevent).
        
        All tools developed in Xnet have a common set of command-line
        parameters for parallelization and other functionality,
        which is provided by the framework.
        
        Try the --help option for each tool for more details.
        Reading the source code of some existing tool should
        suffice to produce new tools under the same flag.
