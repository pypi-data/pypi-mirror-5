Description: "These system calls create and operate on a timer that delivers timer expiration
        notifications via a file descriptor. They provide an alternative to the use of
        setitimer() or timer_create(), with the advantage that the file descriptor may
        be monitored by select(), poll(), and epoll()." [source: manpage timerfg_create]
Platform: Linux
