OSB is a One-Shot-Blog application that makes blog pages for people
using email messages.  It is meant as a demonsration of the newer
routing and Lamson design until I can update the mailing list
application.

To try it do this:

lamson log
lamson start
nosetests
mutt -F muttrc
mutt -F pendingrc

Then you'll see all the gear.  You can use mutt -F muttrc to actually
interact with the running server.
