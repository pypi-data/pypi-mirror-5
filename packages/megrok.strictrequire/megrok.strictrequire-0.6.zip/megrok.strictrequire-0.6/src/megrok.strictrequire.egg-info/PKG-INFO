Description: megrok.strictrequire
        ====================
        
        What is megrok.strictrequire?
        -----------------------------
        
        Strictrequire implements additional grokkers for the various view components
        in Grok. These grokkers determine whether the ``grok.require`` directive has
        been explicitly set on the view component (or on its baseclass).
        
        It will raise an error (and thus prevent the startup of the application) if
        there's a view component without an explicit use of the ``grok.require``
        directive, providing a minimal safety net for finding unprotected views in
        your application.
        
        Making use of megrok.strictrequire
        ----------------------------------
        
        To enable megrok.strictrequire simply list it as a requirement in your
        projects's ``setup.py``. Grok based applications that were bootstrapped with
        a recent version of the ``grokproject`` command will automatically include
        the megrok.strictrequire's ``configure.zcml`` making the additional grokkers
        effective.
        
        Caveat
        ------
        
        If your applications triggers the registration of "third-party" views that do
        not themselves specifically use the ``grok.require`` directive, your
        application will not start.
        
        If you decide you still want to make use of the third-aprty views you should
        make sure the inclusion of the ``configure.zcml`` of megrok.strictrequire
        comes *after* the inclusion of the third-party package by tweaking your
        applications's ``configure.zcml``. For example::
        
            <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
                       xmlns:grok="http://namespaces.zope.org/grok">
              <include package="grok" />
        
              <!-- include this package before mgrok.strictrequire is included -->
              <include package="package_with_unprotected_views" />
        
              <!-- includeDependencies will include megrok.strictrequire -->
              <includeDependencies package="." />
              <grok:grok package="." />
            </configure>
