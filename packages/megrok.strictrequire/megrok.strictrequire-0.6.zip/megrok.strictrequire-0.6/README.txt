megrok.strictrequire
====================

What is megrok.strictrequire?
-----------------------------

Strictrequire implements additional grokkers for the various view components
in Grok. These grokkers determine whether the ``grok.require`` directive has
been explicitly set on the view component (or on its baseclass).

See README.txt in src/megrok/strictrequire/README.txt for additional
information.
