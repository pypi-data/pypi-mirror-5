Description: ModelicaRes
        -----------
        
        The goal of [ModelicaRes] is to provide an open-source tool to effectively
        manage [Modelica] simulations, interpret results, and create publishable
        figures.  It is currently possible to
         - Auto-generate simulation scripts,
         - Run model executables with varying parameters,
         - Browse data,
         - Perform custom calculations, and
         - Produce various plots and diagrams.
        
        The figures are generated via [matplotlib], which
        offers a rich set of plotting routines.  [ModelicaRes] includes convenient
        functions to automatically pre-format and label some figures, like xy plots,
        Bode and Nyquist plots, and Sankey diagrams.  [ModelicaRes] can be scripted or
        run from a [Python] interpreter with math and matrix functions from [NumPy].
        
        For more information, please see the [main project site] or the [doc](doc)
        folder of the package for the full documentation and many examples.  The
        development site is https://github.com/kdavies4/modelicares.
        
        ### Installation
        
        An installable copy of this package can be downloaded from the
        [main project site] or the
        [PyPI page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ModelicaRes).  To install the package,
        first download and extract it.  Then run the set up script
        ([setup.py](setup.py)) from the base folder.  On Windows, use the following
        command:
        
            python setup.py install
        
        On Linux, use:
        
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        The [matplotlibrc](matplotlibrc) file in the base folder has some recommended
        revisions to [matplotlib]'s defaults.  To use it, copy or move the file to the
        working directory or [matplotlib]'s configuration directory.  See
        http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html for details.

        The [pysimulator], [BuildingsPy], [DyMat], and [awesim] projects provide related
        [Python] modules.  [pysimulator] includes an elaborate GUI and supports the
        Functional Model Interface (FMI).  [BuildingsPy] has a **Tester** class that can
        be used for unit testing.  [DyMat] has functions to export [Modelica] simulation
        data to comma separated values (CSV), [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/),
        MATLAB&reg;, and
        [Network Common Data Form (netCDF)](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/).
        [awesim] provides tools to help run simulation experiments and organize the
        results.
