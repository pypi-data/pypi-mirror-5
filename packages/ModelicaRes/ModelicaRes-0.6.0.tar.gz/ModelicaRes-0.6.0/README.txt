ModelicaRes
-----------

`ModelicaRes <http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/>`_ is an
open-source tool to manage `Modelica <http://www.modelica.org>`_
simulations, interpret results, and create publishable figures. It is
currently possible to

-  Auto-generate simulation scripts,
-  Run model executables with varying parameters,
-  Browse data,
-  Perform custom calculations, and
-  Produce various plots and diagrams.

The figures are generated via `matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_,
which offers a rich set of plotting routines.
`ModelicaRes <http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/>`_ includes
convenient functions to automatically pre-format and label some figures,
like xy plots, Bode and Nyquist plots, and Sankey diagrams.
`ModelicaRes <http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/>`_ can be scripted
or run from a `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ interpreter with math
and matrix functions from `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_.

For more information, please see the `main project
site <http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/>`_ or the `doc <doc>`_
folder of the package for the full documentation and many examples. The
development site is https://github.com/kdavies4/modelicares.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An installable copy of this package can be downloaded from the `main
project site <http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/>`_ or the `PyPI
page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ModelicaRes>`_. To install the
package, first download and extract it. Then run the set up script
(`setup.py <setup.py>`_) from the base folder. On Windows, use the
following command:

::

    python setup.py install

On Linux, use:

::

    sudo python setup.py install

The `matplotlibrc <matplotlibrc>`_ file in the base folder has some
recommended revisions to `matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_'s
defaults. To use it, copy or move the file to the working directory or
`matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_'s configuration directory. See
http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html for details.
