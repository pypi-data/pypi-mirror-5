The goal of ModelicaRes_ is to provide an open-source tool to effectively manage
manage Modelica_ simulations, interpret results, and create publishable figures.
It is currently possible to

- Auto-generate simulation scripts,
- Run model executables with varying parameters,
- Browse data,
- Perform custom calculations, and
- Produce various plots and diagrams.

The figures are generated via matplotlib_, which offers a rich set of plotting
routines.  ModelicaRes_ includes convenient functions to automatically
pre-format and label some figures, like xy plots, Bode and Nyquist plots, and
Sankey diagrams.  ModelicaRes_ can be scripted or run from a Python_ interpreter
with math and matrix functions from NumPy_.

For more information, please see the `main project site
<http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/>`_ or the "doc" folder of the package
for the full documentation and many examples.  The development site is
https://github.com/kdavies4/modelicares.

Installation
------------
An installable copy of this package can be downloaded from the `main project
site`_ or the `PyPI page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ModelicaRes>`_.  To
install the package, first download and extract it.  Then run the set up script
(setup.py) from the base folder.  On Windows, use the following command::

   python setup.py install

On Linux, use::

   sudo python setup.py install

The matplotlibrc file in the base folder has some recommended revisions to
matplotlib_'s defaults.  To use it, copy or move the file to the working
directory or matplotlib_'s configuration directory.  See
http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html for details.
