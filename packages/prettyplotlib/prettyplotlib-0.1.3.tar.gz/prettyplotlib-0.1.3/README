prettyplotlib
=============

Python matplotlib-enhancer library which painlessly creates beautiful default `matplotlib`
 plots. Inspired by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)'s work on information design and [Cynthia Brewer](http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/)'s work on [color perception](http://colorbrewer2.org/).

I truly believe that scientific progress is impeded when improper data visualizations are used. I spent a lot of time tweaking my figures to make them more understandable, and realized the scientific world could be a better place if the default parameters for plotting libraries followed recent advances in information design research. And thus `prettyplotlib` was born.

Requirements:

* [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/). Can be installed via `pip install matplotlib` or `easy_install matplotlib`
* [`brewer2mpl`](https://github.com/jiffyclub/brewer2mpl). Can be installed via `pip install brewer2mpl` or `easy_install brewer2mpl`
