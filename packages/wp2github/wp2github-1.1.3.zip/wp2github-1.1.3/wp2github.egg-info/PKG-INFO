Description: wp2github.py
        ============
        
        Command-line tool that converts WordPress-style Readme file to GitHub
        Markdown Readme.
        
        Inspired by https://github.com/benbalter/WP-Readme-to-Github-Markdown
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 2.7
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Also you may use pip:
        
        ::
        
            pip install wp2github
        
        This will create a ``wp2github`` script in /usr/local/bin (linux) or
        c:2.7(windows)
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See: ``wp2github -h``
        
        For example:
        
        ::
        
            wp2github --source SOURCE.txt --target TARGET.md
        
        Versioning
        ----------
        
        This project implements the Semantic Versioning guidelines.
        
        Releases will be numbered with the following format:
        
        ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``
        
        And constructed with the following guidelines:
        
        -  Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
           and patch)
        -  New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
           (and resets the patch)
        -  Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
        
        For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.
