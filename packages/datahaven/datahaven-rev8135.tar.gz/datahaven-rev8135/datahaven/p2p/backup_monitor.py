#This does a bunch of things.  
#1)  monitor the lists of file sent back from suppliers,
#    if there is a gap we need to try to fix it
#    * main class is _BackupMonitor,
#      it saves the lists of files in _BackupListFiles,
#      breaks down the lists of files into info on a single backup in _SupplierBackupInfo
#    * _BlockRebuilder takes care of a single broken block,
#      request what we have available, builds whatever we can
#      and stops either when we have fixed everything
#      or there is nothing more we can do
#    * _BlockRebuilder requests files through io_throttle and sends out the fixed files
#      also through io_throttle
#
#2)  if a backup is unfixable, not enough information, we delete it CleanupBackups in _BackupMonitor
#
#3)  every hour it requests a list of files from each supplier - _hourlyRequestListFiles
#
#4)  every hour it tests a file from each supplier,
#    seeing if they have the data they claim,
#    and that it is correct
#    * data is stored in _SuppliersSet and _SupplierRemoteTestResults,
#    was data good, bad, being rebuilt, or they weren't online 
#    and we got no data on the result
#    * if a supplier hasn't been seen in settings.FireInactiveSupplierIntervalHours()
#    we replace them
#
#
# Strategy for automatic backups
#
# 1) Full backup to alternating set of nodes every 2 weeks.
#
# 2) Full monthly, then incremental weekly and daily
#
# 3) One time full and then incremental monthly, weekly
#
# 4) Break alphabetical list of files into N parts and do full
#    backup on one of those and incrementals on the rest.
#    So we no longer need part of the incremental history
#      every time, and after N times older stuff can toss.
#      so every day is part full and part incremental.  Cool.
#
#  Want user to be able to specify what he wants, or at least
#  select from a few reasonable choices.
#
#
# May just do (1) to start with.
#
# This code also wakes up every day and fires off localtester, remotetester
#   on some reasonable random stuff.
#
# This manages the whole thing, so after GUI, this has the highest level control functions.
#
# Some competitors let people choose what days to backup on.  Not sure this
#   is really so great though, once we have incremental.
#
# Some can handle partial file changes.  So if a 500 MB mail file only has
# a little bit appended, only the little bit is backed up.
#
# Some competitors can turn the computer off after a backup, but
# we need it to stay on for P2P stuff.
#
# need to record if zip, tar, dump, etc
#
# If we do regular full backups often, then we might not bother scrubbing older stuff.
# Could reduce the bandwidth needed (since scrubbing could use alot.l
