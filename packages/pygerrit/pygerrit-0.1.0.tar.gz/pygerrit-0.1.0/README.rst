Pygerrit - Client library for interacting with Gerrit Code Review
=================================================================

Pygerrit is a Python library that can be used to process the data from events
generated by the Gerrit Code Review system.

Gerrit offers a "stream-events" command that is run over ssh, and returns back
a stream of events (new change uploaded, change merged, comment added, etc) as
JSON text.

This library handles the parsing of the JSON text from the event stream,
encapsulating the data in event objects (Python classes), and allowing the
client to fetch them from a queue. It also allows users to easily add handling
of custom event types, for example if they are running a customised Gerrit
installation with non-standard events.

For examples of usage, please refer to example.py.
