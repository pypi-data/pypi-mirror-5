Description: Pygerrit - Client library for interacting with Gerrit Code Review
        =================================================================
        
        Pygerrit is a Python library to interact with the
        `Gerrit Code Review`_ system over ssh.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install pygerrit, simply:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install pygerrit
        
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        Pygerrit runs on Ubuntu 10.4 and Mac OSX 10.8.4 with Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x.
        Support for other platforms and Python versions is not guaranteed.
        
        To connect to the review server, pygerrit requires the ssh connection
        parameters (hostname, port, username) to be present in the ``.ssh/config``
        file for the current user:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            Host review
              HostName review.example.net
              Port 29418
              User username
        
        Event Stream
        ------------
        
        Gerrit offers a ``stream-events`` command that is run over ssh, and returns back
        a stream of events (new change uploaded, change merged, comment added, etc) as
        JSON text.
        
        This library handles the parsing of the JSON text from the event stream,
        encapsulating the data in event objects (Python classes), and allowing the
        client to fetch them from a queue. It also allows users to easily add handling
        of custom event types, for example if they are running a customised Gerrit
        installation with non-standard events.
        
        Refer to the `example`_ script for a brief example of how the interface
        works.
