    Implement a proxy checker class.
    
    Add a proxy checker class for local checks that doesn't do anything,
    but instead registers a command option that allows for local, in-tree
    checks.

    turns out that it's super important, otherwise the import test gets
    messed up by _ and our assumption that it gets imported from the
    execution entrypoints in bin/ and the test runner.

    Update tox.ini to support RHEL 6.x.
    
    In order to support running unit tests on RHEL 6.x we need to patch
    eventlet with contrib/redhat-eventlet.patch. We already
    have support for this in the tools/install_venv_common.py but we need
    to make a couple changes to allow tox to consume this:
    
    1) Sync in the latest intall_venv_common.py from oslo. This changes
     patch to use the -N option (ignore already applied patches) and makes
     it safe to call the patching function more than once.
    
    2) Add a new patch_tox_venv.py script in tools.
    
    3) Update tox.ini to call patch_tox_venv.py before it runs tests and
    coverage.

    Unpin suds dependency version
    
    Fixes bug #1133247
    
    suds is used by the vmware driver and the dependency has always been

      67e63ba8 (Sateesh Chodapuneedi 2011-03-07 18:10:48 +0530 17) suds==0.4
    
    0.4 was released in September 2010 and there hasn't been a release
    since. In fact, there has only been 16 commits since then and none of
    them look to break the existing API.
    
    If there's no reason to expect the next version to break us, we should
    unpin. Indeed, we want to know early if upstream does break its API.

    We've been pinned to the same version of Cheetah since May 2011:

    this was released in December 2010 and there hasn't been a release since:
    
      https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Cheetah/2.4.4
    
    There's no particular reason to believe a future release of Cheetah will break
    us (only 6 commits since 2.4.4 and they all look like bugfixes), so we should
    change to:
    
      Cheetah>=2.4.4

    Remove function redefinitions
    
    A number of tests have never been run due to another function having
    the same name. Duplicate names have been changed and additionally
    pyflakes check will now fail in such situations.
    
    Also fix ovs ethernet driver test which was incorrect.

    Use oslo-config-2013.1b4
    
    The cfg API is now available via the oslo-config library, so switch to
    it and remove the copied-and-pasted version.
    
    Add the 2013.1b4 tarball to tools/pip-requires - this will be changed
    to 'oslo-config>=2013.1' when oslo-config is published to pypi. This
    will happen in time for grizzly final.
    
    Add dependency_links to setup.py so that oslo-config can be installed
    from the tarball URL specified in pip-requires.
    
    Remove the 'deps = pep8==1.3.3' from tox.ini as it means all the other
    deps get installed with easy_install which can't install oslo-config
    from the URL.
    
    Make tools/hacking.py include oslo in IMPORT_EXCEPTIONS like it already
    does for paste. It turns out imp.find_module() doesn't correct handle
    namespace packages.
    
    Retain dummy cfg.py file until keystoneclient middleware has been
    updated (I18c450174277c8e2d15ed93879da6cd92074c27a).

    Fix hacking tests on osx
    
    There were a few incompatibilities with the hacking tests and
    OSX. Readlink -f doesn't work so use cd and pwd instead. Importing
    a module with path separators doesn't work, so recursively import
    the module. Finally the extra / in the find command was not needed.

    Harmonize PEP8 checking between tox and run_tests.sh
    
    Tox and run_tests.sh were running PEP8 checks against different
    file-sets. This patch refactors the logic to determine which files to
    run PEP8 checks on into `tools/run_pep8.sh` where it can be called by
    both tox and `run_tests.sh`.
    
    Additional fixes:
    
    Some of our Python XenAPI Dom0 plugins don't end in *.py but should
    still be checked by PEP8. This patches fixes the hacking.py violations
    in the files and adds them back to the srcfiles list.
    
    Merged tools/unused_imports.sh into tools/run_pep8.sh

    * Old style relative import testing based on module search
    * Inspection based solution replaced by PYTHONPATH search
      in order to avoid module compile and initialization steps

    This solution is faster and safer, but does not able to recognize

    support reloctable venv roots in testing framework
    
    run_tests.sh, with_venv.sh, and the install_venv.py scripts now
    support relocating the venv root to another location.
    
    All 3 scripts now support new envinroment variables to configure
    the location of the venv and the tools directory. To maintain
    compatability the defaults are set to the current values.
    
    venv_path = Location of the virtualenv directory
    	Default: $(pwd)
    
    venv_name = Name of the virtualenv directory
    	Default: .venv
    
    tools_path = Location of the tools directory
    	Default: $(pwd)
    
    Additionally the run_tests.sh script also takes these value as
    arguments and will pass them along accordingly.
    
    --virtual-env-path <path>   Location of the virtualenv directory
                                 Default: $(pwd)
    --virtual-env-name <name>   Name of the virtualenv directory

    Fix import for install_venv.py
    
    On systems that don't use devstack the nova directory
    doesn't automatically get added to the python path. This
    breaks tools/install_venv_common.py which imports from
    nova.openstack.common. This fixes the issue by manually
    adding the nova root directory to the python path before
    tools/install_venv_common.py is imported.

    xenapi: Add cleanup_sm_locks script
    
    XenServer 5.6 and 6.0 don't appear to be cleaning up sm locks when using
    a FileSR. When enough locks accumulate, this causes image related
    operations to fail.
    
    This cleanup script is a stop-gap solution that can be run against all
    of the dom0's in the cluster to prevent too many locks from
    accumulating.
    
    We can remove this script when the root-cause is fixed upstream.

    testtools 0.9.25 introduces a new dependency on the 'extras' package, but
    it does so in a way to prevents itself from being installed without the
    'extras' package already installed.
    
    Work around the problem for now by avoiding the problematic release.

    This is no problem for Jenkins but not very friendly if we run
    lintstack locally. Every time after it's done, git is in detached

    enable hacking.py self tests
    
    pep8 and hacking.py (by inheritance) have the ability to run self
    tests via docstrings, if we format the comments correctly, and change
    the docstring test regex. Include self testing in our normal pep8
    tests.
    
    fix the comments to actually be test case compliant
    
    fix nova_import_alphabetical to pass on short import lists (only 2
    lines, starting at the beginning of a file)
    
    comment where it doesn't appear that hacking.py tests are working
    (though there could be deeper black magic in some of them).
    
    fix a doc string in pep8 self tests that breaks N301
    
    fix the fact that pep8 error strings are supposed to start with
    \w\d\d\d, we were just lucking out on some formatting because the
    string NOVA happened to be only 4 chars long.
    
    Add a couple of escapes so that we don't recursively fail on our
    own fail self tests for comments. (boy that's fun)

    Try out a new nova.conf.sample format
    
    The current format strikes me as fairly bizarre:
    
      - Having the help message after the option it's documenting seems
        backwards to me. Compare to the glance or swift samples.
    
      - Printing the type as e.g. "(StrOpt)" isn't very user friendly
    
      - We're creating a global pound symbol shortage
    
    Switch to a new format that looks much more like a normal config file.

    We had previously been ignoring all our custom N4xx hacking.py

    to N402 only "single line docstrings should end with period".
    
    It also fixes the N401 parser to catch only docstrings, and
    not tripple quoted string blocks used later on in a function.

    Use testr to run nova unittests.
    
    Convert nova from using nosetests to testr for its test runner. Some
    tests had to be modified to get them to run properly under testr.
    
    run_tests.sh has been updated to run testr instead of nosetests.
    
    Coverage is collected by running subunit.run under coverage.py when the
    coverage environment is selected.
    
    Note that you will need to rebuild your virtualenvs as nose is being
    removed from the dependency lists and is being replaced by testr. Tests
    will run in different processes once this test is merged so you cannot
    use test classes to pass information between tests. Each test should be
    a proper independent unit. Additionally the -x and -d flags to
    run_tests.sh have been removed as there are currently no decent
    approximations for those functions.

     Completely remove cfg's disable_interspersed_args()
     argparse support for cfg
    
    The main cfg API change is that CONF() no longer returns the un-parsed
    CLI arguments. To handle these args, you need to use the support for
    positional arguments or sub-parsers.
    
    Switching nova-manage to use sub-parser based CLI arguments means the
    following changes in behaviour:
    
     - no more lazy matching of commands - e.g. 'nova-manage proj q' will
       no longer work. If we find out about common abbreviations used in
       peoples' scripts, we can easily add those.
    
     - the help output displayed if you run nova-manage without any args
       (or just a category) has changed
    
     - 'nova-manage version list' is no longer equivalent to
       'nova-manage version'

    Add generic customization hooks via decorator.
    
    Hooks add the ability to insert custom code around operations that
    declare a named hook:
    
    e.g.
    
    @hooks.add_hooks('create_instance')
    def create_instance(....):
       ....
    
    The above hook allows Hook objects to be run 'pre' and 'post' the
    execution of create_instance()
    
    Hook objects are discovered via the setuptools entry point group
    'nova.hooks'.

    Use CONF.import_opt() for nova.config opts
    
    The only reason for importing nova.config now is where one of the
    options defined in that file is needed. Rather than importing
    nova.config using an import statement, use CONF.import_opt() so
    that it is clear which option we actually require.
    
    In future, we will move many options out of nova.config so many
    of these import_opt() calls will either go away or cause a module
    other than nova.config to be imported.

    Remove nova.config.CONF
    
    Modules import nova.config for two reasons right now - firstly, to
    reference nova.config.CONF and, secondly, if they use one of the
    options defined in nova.config.
    
    Often modules import nova.openstack.common.cfg and nova.config
    which is a bit pointless since they could just use cfg.CONF if
    they just want to nova.config in order to reference CONF.
    
    Let's just use cfg.CONF everywhere and we can explicitly state
    where we actually require options defined in nova.config.

    Fix hacking.py naivete regarding lines that look like imports
    
    Right now, any line that starts with "from" (after whitespace
    removal) is considered an import line. That assumption leads to
    some unsavory parsing and crashing if the line doesn't match
    the expected format.
    
    This patch checks to make sure that the word "import" is in the line
    as well as starting with "from", which at least gets us a bit closer
    to a reasonable assumption.

    We have a fake ldap implementation for testing, but the tests still

    It removes the unneccessary FakeLdapDNS in favor of using the real
    LdapDNS with the module stubbed out. It also removes the dependency
    on python-ldap from test-requires.

    This reverts commit 30e513309fe25af358b4d9ed47da2c7574fc0f06.
    
    The python mysql module was removed from test-requires in favor
    of test-options, but the work to actually use that was never
    completed.  Revert the change so that mysql testing is actually
    performed again.

    Loosen anyjson dependency to avoid clash with ceilometer
    
    Ceilometer depends on anyjson 0.3.1, whereas nova requires
    exacly 0.2.4.
    
    The net effect is a devstack with ceilometer installed will
    appear to work initially, as ceilometer is sparked up after
    nova. However, if any of the nova services are subsequently
    restarted, they fail with:
    
      pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: anyjson==0.2.4
    
    By simply allowing the nova anyjson dependency version to
    be greater than as opposed to an exact match, we can avoid
    the clash.

    Replaced default hostname function from gethostname to getfqdn
    
    Fixes bug 1055503
    
    The standard behaviour of the 'gethostname' function in Python differs from
    Linux to Windows. A common Linux configuration returns the FQDN, while a
    Windows one returns only the host name.
    
    To resolve inconsistent node naming in deployments that mix windows and
    Linux, it is proposed to use 'getfqdn' as default function instead of
    'gethostname'. This is function is more predictable in all cases.

    Add optional flag to allow cinder endpoint to be defined by flag rather
    than extracted from the request context's service catalog.  No change to
    default behavior.
    
    This flag allows deployers to use a seperate management endpoint for

    just use an auth system that doesn't add/forward the catalog along with
    the request (e.g. noauth).

    Include CommonConfigOpts options in sample config
    
    Options defined by CommonConfigOpts are declared within the class rather
    than at module level, so they weren't being included in the sample conf.
    
    Also, in essex (and up until commit 991614add8), the sample conf file
    didn't contain these options but they included the hyphen in the name.
    The hyphen is only used on the command line, it is converted to an
    underscore automatically in the config file. Use opt.dest rather than
    opt.name as the config file key. Fixes bug #1034970.

    Drop AES functions and pycrypto dependency
    
    At some point IV parameter has been removed making these functions
    dangerous to use unless keys are unique on every message. Since the
    functions were added the original consumer has disappeared too. With
    no more users it's better to get rid of the incomplete encryption system
    entirely.
    
    These were the only functions using pycrypto module directly, so it was

    Improve external lock implementation
    
    Remove a number of limitations from the external locks.
    - They can be nested now
    - They do not need external cleanup in case of failures
    - They do not rely on lockfile or greenlet internal implementation
    
    New implementation is based on fcntl locks and any crashing process
    will drop the lock. It does not have to rely on any cleanup code or
    handling exceptions. Because no cleanup is needed, a number of tests
    have been removed.
    This implementation is not portable outside of POSIX/BSD/SVR4 systems.
    
    Fcntl locks should work correctly with NFS mounts.
    
    Locks are cleaned up after the tests finish running via run_tests.sh,
    even though it's not strictly needed.
    
    This change requires eventlet >= 0.9.17.

    First of all, our pep8 exclude was excluding openstack, to trap
    for not doing pep8 checks on openstack/common, which comes from elsewhere.
    But, pep8 strips filenames down to basename when doing exclude checks on
    them, which makes no sense. To fix this, grab the two functions from pep8,
    fix them, and monkeypatch them from within hacking.py.
    
    Patch has been submitted upstream as:
    
      https://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/pull/111
    
    Also, changed the exclude to catch just openstack/common.

    XenAPI: Add script to destroy cached images.
    
    Operations will want the ability to clear out cached images when
    disk-space becomes an issue.
    
    This script allows ops to clear out all cached images or just cached
    images that aren't in current use.

    $ ./bin/nova-manage  config  convert --help
    Usage: nova-manage config convert <args> [options]
    
    Options:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --infile=<path>   old-style flagfile to convert to config
      --outfile=<path>  path for output file. Writes configto stdout if not
                        specified.

    Nova should not depend on python-novaclient. Remove it.
    
    Note: In order to get unit tests to pass I had to add in
    a temporary dependency on httplib2. This is due to the fact
    that pip installing glance does not properly setup all
    the dependencies. See LP Bug #975483 for details.

    Support non-UTC timestamps in changes-since filter
    
    Fixes nova aspect of lp 837464
    
    Prevously only Zulu time was supported in the changes-since filter,
    i.e. timestamps formatted as %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
    
    We now support arbitrary timezones, with the offset from UTC expressed
    via the ISO 8601 ±hh:mm notation.
    
    Microsecond accurracy is also optionally supported in timestamps.
    
    Notes:
    
    - nova.utils.parse_isotime(), isotime() & normalized_time() are
      prime candidates for promotion to openstack-common, as these
      methods were duplicated from my corresponding glance patch:
    
        https://review.openstack.org/#change,4198
    
    - this patch introduces a new dependency on python-iso8601, which
      has already been packaged for Fedora, EPEL and Ubuntu/Debian.

    Get rid of distutils.extra.
    
    We moved to DistUtilsExtra because it promised a more automatic workflow
    from setup.py. It doesn't actually deliver though, and it also vomits
    warnings during setup.py usage, and also breaks pip integration.
    
    So this is going back to babel. Mostly folks shouldn't need to know
    anything about this. We'll need to update the translations import
    jobs in Jenkins, and we might need to add a corresponding translations
    upload job that runs post-merge.
    
    Translations installation doesn't fully work - but it actually wasn't fully
    working before. Getting this part of the project done now though is a
    pre-requisite for using tox for multi-python testing (tox starts by
    creating an sdist tarball and then installing it into the venv, which
    is just 100% broken with DistUtilsExtra)

    Merge "PEP8 remove direct type comparisons"

    PEP8 remove direct type comparisons
    
    Fixes bug #910763
    
    According to PEP8,
    - Object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead
          of comparing types directly.
    
            Yes: if isinstance(obj, int):
    
            No: if type(obj) is type(1):
    
          When checking if an object is a string, keep in mind that it might be a
          unicode string too! In Python 2.3, str and unicode have a common base
          class, basestring, so you can do:
    
            if isinstance(obj, basestring):

    install_venv: pip install M2Crypto doesn't work on Fedora
    
    ... so use the system m2crypto library instead.
    
    M2Crypto won't build on Fedora because of some bizarre differences with
    Fedora's OpenSSL headers. I can get it to build by doing e.g.
    
     $> python ./tools/install_venv.py
     $> cd .nova-venv/build/M2Crypto
     $> for i in SWIG/_ec.i SWIG/_evp.i; do sed -i -e "s/opensslconf/opensslconf-x86_64/" $i ; done
     $> cd -
     $> SWIG_FEATURES=-cpperraswarn ./tools/with_venv.sh pip install M2Crypto
    
    but that's clearly no fun. It should be fine to just use the system
    version.

    install_venv: don't use --no-site-packages with virtualenv
    
    libvirt isn't listed in pip-requires because (a) it's not in PyPi and
    (b) you always want to use libvirt's python bindings that matches the
    version of libvirt installed on the system.
    
    Currently, running nova-compute in virtualenv fails because libvirt
    can't be imported. The --no-site-packages flag is what prevents this.
    Everything seems to work fine without it. To verify, try deleting the
    no-global-site-packages.txt from your .nova-venv.

    Use latest version of SQLAlchemy
    
    Fedora 16 has SQLAlchemy-0.7.2 and it seems to work fine with Nova,
    modulo these occassional migration errors that crop up. The
    foreign_keys set in 047 issue is the third such problem fixed lately.
    
    Is there any particular reason to stick with 0.6.3?

    Don't use GitPython for authors check
    
    I hit this issue with an older GitPython version:
    
      https://bugzilla.redhat.com/740852
    
    Seeing as all GitPython is doing for us is running:
    
      $> git rev-list --pretty=raw HEAD
    
    and parsing the output, I figure it's just as easy for us to run git
    directly.

    Does injection of Multi-NIC information to instances with Operating system flavors Ubuntu, Windows and RHEL.
    vmwareapi virt driver now relies on calls to network manager instead of nova db calls for network configuration information of instance.

    Adds support for "extra specs", additional capability requirements associated with instance types.
    
    The instance_type dictionary now has a new extra_specs field.
    
    Adds a new table to the database: InstanceTypeExtraSpecs. This is modeled on the existing InstanceMetadata table, except that it is associated with additional capability requirements of instance types rather than generic metadata for instances.
    
    The InstanceTypeFilter has been modified to check for extra specs.
    
    This will ultimately be needed for supporting heterogeneous instances: we'll annotate the instance types with info about whether GPUs are present, so users will be able to request something like a "cg1.4xlarge".
    
    Includes api support as an extension for querying and modifying this info.

    The VNC Proxy is an OpenStack component that allows users of Nova to access
    their instances through a websocket enabled browser (like Google Chrome).
    
    A VNC Connection works like so:
    
    * User connects over an api and gets a url like http://ip:port/?token=xyz
    * User pastes url in browser
    * Browser connects to VNC Proxy though a websocket enabled client like noVNC
    * VNC Proxy authorizes users token, maps the token to a host and port of an
      instance's VNC server
    * VNC Proxy initiates connection to VNC server, and continues proxying until
      the session ends

    * Updated document vmware_readme.rst to mention VLAN networking
    * Corrected docstrings as per pep0257 recommentations.
    * Stream-lined the comments.
    * Updated code with locals() where ever applicable.
    * VIM : It stands for VMware Virtual Infrastructure Methodology. We have used the terminology from VMware.  we have added a question in FAQ inside vmware_readme.rst in doc/source
    * New fake db: vmwareapi fake module uses a different set of fields and hence the structures required are different. Ex: bridge : 'xenbr0' does not hold good for VMware environment and bridge : 'vmnic0' is used instead. Also return values varies, hence went for implementing separate fake db.
    * Now using eventlet library instead and removed io_utils.py from branch.
    * Now using glance.client.Client instead of homegrown code to talk to Glance server to handle images.
    * Corrected all mis-spelled function names and corresponding calls. Yeah, an auto-complete side-effect!

    Implement support for streaming images from Glance when using the XenAPI virtualization backend, as per the bexar-xenapi-support-for-glance blueprint.
    
    Images may be streamed raw, or will be streamed into the right place to allow room for an MBR and partition table, if using non-raw images.  PV vs HVM detection now occurs on the image, immediately after it has been streamed.  External kernel / ramdisk are also supported in this mode.
    
    Unit test changes include a partial Glance simulator, which is stubbed in place of glance.client.Client.  This allows us to pass through the VM spawn path with either glance or objectstore backends enabled; the unit tests now cover both.  A dependency upon glance has been added to pip-requires, in order to pull the Glance client code into the venv.
    
    This includes minor fixes to nova.image.glance.  This code is expected to be heavily reworked anyway with the image-service-use-glance-clients work.

    This removes the need for the custom udev rule for iscsi devices.  It instead attaches the device based on /dev/disk/by-path/ which should make the setup of nova-volume a little easier.

    2 changes in doing PEP8 & Pylint cleaning:
     * adding pep8 and pylint to the PIP requirements files for Tools
     * light cleaning work (mostly formatting) on nova/endpoints/cloud.py
    
    Note: On my laptop, I had two tests failing just with a basic setup. I checked against all the tests again after cleanup, and had no additional or different failures.

    Added exit code checking to process.py (twisted process utils).  A bit of class refactoring to make it work & cleaner.
    Also added some more instructive messages to install_venv.py, because otherwise people that don't know what they're doing will install the wrong pip... i.e. I did :-)

    directory.

Author: Andy Smith <termie@preciousroy.local>
Date:   Fri Jul 23 04:44:23 2010 +0200

    Adds a Makefile to fill dependencies for testing.
    
    Depends upon pip being installed, but pip is pretty much
    the standard nowadays and is just an easy_install away if
    it isn't there.
    
    The only dependency installed on to the system is
    virtualenv which is used to make the other dependencies
    local to the current environment.
    
    Does not remove the need to install redis by hand, though
    I am in favor of making that possible (using aptitude on
    linux and brew on os x)
    
    I look forward to cutting away at some of these
    dependencies in further commits.
