Shake-Files
======================

Shake-Files allows your Werkzeug-based application to flexibly and 
efficiently handle file uploads.

You can create different sets of uploads - one for document attachments, one
for photos, etc. - and configure them to save tthe files in different places, 
creating the directories on demand, according to a pattern defined by you.
