js.jquery_autosize
******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery Autosize`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware
of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery Autosize`: https://github.com/jackmoore/autosize/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_tooltip``) are published to some URL.
