        Installation
        ============
        
        Use pip to install:
        ```Shell
        pip install qualysapi
        ```
        
        NOTE: If you would like to experiment without installing globally, look into 'virtualenv'.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * requests (http://docs.python-requests.org)
        * lxml (http://lxml.de/)
        
        Tested successfully on Python 2.7.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        By default, the package will ask at the command prompt for username and password. By default, the package connects to the Qualys documented host (qualysapi.qualys.com).
        
        You can override these settings and prevent yourself from typing credentials by doing any of the following:
        
        1. By running the following Python, `qualysapi.connect(remember_me=True)`. This automatically generates a .qcrc file in your current working directory, scoping the configuration to that directory.
        2. By running the following Python, `qualysapi.connect(remember_me_always=True)`. This automatically generates a .qcrc file in your home directory, scoping the configuratoin to all calls to qualysapi, regardless of the directory.
        3. By creating a file called '.qcrc' in your home directory or directory of the Python script.
        
        Example .qcrc
        -------------
        ```INI
        ; Note, it should be possible to omit any of these entries.
        
        [info]
        hostname = qualysapi.serviceprovider.com
        username = jerry
        password = I<3Elaine
        
        [proxy]
        
        ; proxy_protocol set to https, if not specified.
        proxy_url = proxy.mycorp.com
        
        ; proxy_port will override any port specified in proxy_url
        proxy_port = 8080
        
        ; proxy authentication
        proxy_username = kramer
        proxy_password = giddy up!
        
        [curl]
        use_curl = True
        
        ; Optional: Use subprocess to actually call cURL instead of human_curl.
        ; Note this is incompatiable with WAS API and Asset Management API with no plans to support them.
        use_subprocess = True
        
        ```
