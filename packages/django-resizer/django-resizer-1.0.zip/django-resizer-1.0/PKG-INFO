Description: Django Resizer
        ==============
        
        Django Resizer allows images to be dynamically resized and/or cropped through a URL. This is very useful when you have a third-party "hot-linking" your images and they won't have access to template tag to dynamically resize images like [easy-thumbnails](https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails) or [sorl-thumbnail](https://github.com/sorl/sorl-thumbnail) provides.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Run `pip install django-resizer`
        
        Add `resizer` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'resizer',
        )
        ```
        
        To your sites `url.py` add:
        
        ```python
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            ...
            url(r'^resizer/(?P<path>.*)/$', 'resizer.views.resize', name='image_resize'),
        )
        ```
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The resizing and cropping capabilities rely on the easy-thumbnails app.
        
        To resize an image with a height and width of no more than 50px and with the image ratio perserved:
        
        `/resizer/images/picture.jpg?size=50,50`
        
        The path after `/resizer` should be the path to the image from your settings `MEDIA_ROOT`. The query string should be `size=[width],[height]`.
        
        To resize an image to have a height and width of extactly 50px:
        
        `/resizer/images/picture.jpg?size=50,50&crop=smart`
