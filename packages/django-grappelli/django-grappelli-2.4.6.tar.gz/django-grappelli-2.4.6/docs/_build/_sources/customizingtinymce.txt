How to customize TinyMCE
========================

We are delivering a very basic TinyMCE skin with Grappelli which fits the needs of most use cases.
While there are requests to add certain features but we will stick to the basic version for reasons of maintainability.

The easiest way to custmize TinyMCE is to use a completely different version by
	* copying our version to a different directory or
	* using a fresh install from the TinyMCE website. 

You can add custom TinyMCE-JS by using a Media inner class on your ModelAdmin (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-media-definitions).
