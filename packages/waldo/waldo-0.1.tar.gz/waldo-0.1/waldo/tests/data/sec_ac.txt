Description: Secondary accession numbers: index
Name:        SEC_AC.TXT
Release:     28-Jun-2011

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file lists all secondary accession numbers in UniProtKB (Swiss-Prot and
TrEMBL), together with their corresponding current primary accession number(s).
Accession numbers become secondary when entries are merged or split. When two
entries are merged into one, the accession numbers from both entries are stored
for the new entry.

If an existing entry is split into two or more entries (a rare occurrence),
the original accession numbers are retained in all the derived entries and a
new primary accession number is added to all the entries.

An accession number is dropped only when the data to which it was assigned have
been completely removed from the database. Accession numbers deleted from
Swiss-Prot are listed in the document file delac_sp.txt and those deleted
from TrEMBL are listed in delac_tr.txt.
