Description: Utils
        =====
        
        Sometimes you write a function over and over again; sometimes you look up at
        the ceiling and ask "why, Guido, why isn't this included in the standard
        library?"
        
        Well, we perhaps can't answer that question. But we can collect those functions
        into a centralized place!
        
        Provided things

        Utils is broken up into broad swathes of functionality, to ease the task of
        remembering where exactly something lives.
