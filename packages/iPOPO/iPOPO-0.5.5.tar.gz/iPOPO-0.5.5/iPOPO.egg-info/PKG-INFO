        ####################################
        
        This is iPOPO, a component model framework for Python based on SOA principles.
        It is based on Pelix, an SOA framework.

        Compatibility
        #############
        
        Pelix and iPOPO are tested using `Tox <http://testrun.org/tox/latest/>`_ and
        `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/tcalmant/ipopo>`_ with:
        
        * Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3
        
          .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/tcalmant/ipopo.png?branch=master
             :target: https://travis-ci.org/tcalmant/ipopo
        
        It is also manually tested with:
        
        * Pypy 1.9
        
        To use iPOPO on Python 2.6, it is necessary to install the *importlib* module
        back-port, using ``pip install importlib``.
        To execute iPOPO tests on this version, you also need to install the *unittest2*
        module.
        
        iPOPO is available on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iPOPO>`_.
        
        
        Release notes
        #############
        
        See the CHANGELOG.rst file to see what changed in previous releases.
        
        iPOPO 0.5.5
        ***********
        
        Project
        =======
        
        The license of the iPOPO project is now an Apache License 2.0.
        
        
        Framework
        =========
        
        * ``get_*_service_reference*()`` methods have a default LDAP filter set to
          ``None``. Only the service specification is required, event if set to
          ``None``.
        
        * Added a context ``use_service(context, svc_ref)``, that allows to consume a
          service in a ``with`` block:
        
          .. code-block:: python
        
             from pelix.utilities import use_service
             with use_service(bundle_context, svc_ref) as svc:
                svc.foo()
        
          Service will be released automatically.
        
        
        iPOPO
        =====
        
        * Added the *Handler Factory* pattern : all instance handlers are created by
          their factory, called by iPOPO according to the handler IDs found in the
          factory context.
          This will simplify the creation of new handlers.
        
        * Added a context ``use_ipopo(context)``, that allows to use the iPOPO service
          in a ``with`` block:
        
          .. code-block:: python
        
             from pelix.ipopo.constants import use_ipopo
             with use_ipopo(bundle_context) as ipopo:
                ipopo.instantiate('my.factory', 'my.instance', {})
        
          The iPOPO service will be released automatically.
        
        
        Services
        ========
        
        * Added the ConfigurationAdmin service
        * Added the FileInstall service
