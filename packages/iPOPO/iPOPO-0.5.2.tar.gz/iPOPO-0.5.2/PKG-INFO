Description: iPOPO : A component model for Python
        ####################################
        
        This is iPOPO, a component model framework for Python based on SOA principles.
        It is based on Pelix, an SOA framework.
        
        See http://ipopo.coderxpress.net for documentation and more information.

        Compatibility
        #############
        
        The package has been tested with:
        
        * Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1 and 3.2
        * Pypy 1.8, 1.9
        
        To work with Python 2.6, the *importlib* module back-port must be installed.
        It is available on PyPI.
        
        
        Release notes
        #############
        
        iPOPO 0.5.2
        ***********
        
        Additions
        =========
        
        iPOPO Decorators
        ----------------
        
        * An error is now logged if a class is manipulated twice. Decorators executed
          after the first manipulation, i.e. upon ``@ComponentFactory()``, are ignored.
        
        
        HTTP Service
        ------------
        
        * New servlet binding parameters:
        
          * http.name : Name of HTTP service. The name of component instance in the case
            of the basic implementation.
        
          * http.extra : Extra properties of the HTTP service. In the basic
            implementation, this the content of the *http.extra* property of the
            HTTP server component
        
        * New method ``accept_binding(path, params)`` in servlets.
          This allows to refuse the binding with a server before to test the
          availability of the registration path, thus to avoid raising a meaningless
          exception.
        
        
        Remote Services
        ---------------
        
        * End points are stored according to their framework
        
        * Added a method ``lost_framework(uid)`` in the registry of imported services,
          which unregisters all the services provided by the given framework.
        
        
        Shell
        -----
        
        * Shell *help* command now accepts a command name to print a specific
          documentation
        
        
        Bugs fixed
        ==========
        
        iPOPO Decorators
        ----------------
        
        * Better handling of inherited and overridden methods: a decorated method can
          now be overridden in a child class, with the name, without warnings.
        
        * Better error logs, with indication of the error source file and line
        
        
        iPOPO 0.5.1
        ***********
        
        Additions
        =========
        
        Shell
        -----
        
        * The remote shell now provides a service, ``pelix.shell.remote``, with a
          ``get_access()`` method that returns the *(host, port)* tuple where the
          remote shell is waiting for clients.
        
        
        HTTP Service
        ------------
        
        * The HTTP service now supports the update of servlet services properties.
          A servlet service can now update its registration path property after having
          been bound to a HTTP service.
        * A *500 server error* page containing an exception trace is now generated when
          a servlet fails.
        
        
        Bugs fixed
        ==========
        
        Framework
        ---------
        
        * Bundle.update() now logs the SyntaxError exception that be raised in Python 3.
        
        Shell
        -----
        
        * Fixed the ``threads`` command that wasn't working on Python 3.
        
        
        HTTP Service
        ------------
        
        * The ``bound_to()`` method of a servlet is called only after the HTTP service
          is ready to accept clients.

        API Changes
        ===========
        
        Framework
        ---------
        
        * ``BundleContext.install_bundle()`` now returns the ``Bundle`` object instead
          of the bundle ID.
          ``BundleContext.get_bundle()`` has been updated to accept both IDs and
          ``Bundle`` objects in order to keep a bit of compatibility
        
        * ``Framework.get_symbolic_name()`` now returns *pelix.framework* instead of
          *org.psem2m.pelix*
        
        * ``ServiceEvent.get_type()`` is renamed ``get_kind()``. The other name is
          still available but is declared deprecated (a warning is logged on its first
          use).
        
        
        Shell
        -----
        
        * Shell command methods now take an ``IOHandler`` object in parameter instead
          of input and output file-like streams.
          This hides the compatibility tricks between Python 2 and 3 and simplifies the
          output formatting.
        
        
        Additions
        =========
        
        Project
        -------
        
        * Added this "release notes" page to the web site
        
        Framework
        ---------
        
        * ``BundleContext.install_visiting(path, visitor)``:
        
          * Visits the given path and installs the found modules if the visitor accepts
            them
        
        * ``BundleContext.install_package(path)`` (*experimental*):
        
          * Installs all the modules found in the package at the given path
          * Based on ``install_visiting()``
        
        
        iPOPO
        -----
        
        * Components with a ``pelix.ipopo.auto_restart`` property set to *True* are
          automatically re-instantiated after their bundle has been updated.
        
        
        Services
        --------
        
        * Remote Services: use services of a distant Pelix instance
        
          * Multicast discovery
          * XML-RPC transport (not fully usable)
          * JSON-RPC transport (based on a patched version of jsonrpclib)
        
        * EventAdmin: send events (a)synchronously
        
        iPOPO 0.4
        *********
        
        Version 0.4 fixes many bugs and provides new features:
        
        Pelix
        =====
        
        * ``create_framework()`` utility method
        * The framework has been refactored, allowing more efficient services and
          events handling
        
        iPOPO
        =====
        
        * A component can provide multiple services
        * A service controller can be injected for each provided service, to
          activate or deactivate its registration
        * Dependency injection and service providing mechanisms have been refactored,
          using a basic handler concept.
        
        Services
        ========
        
        * Added a HTTP service component, using the concept of *servlet*
        * Added an extensible shell, interactive and remote, simplifying the usage
          of a framework instance
        
        iPOPO 0.3
        *********
        
        Packages have been renamed. As the project goes public, it may not have
        relations to isandlaTech projects anymore.
