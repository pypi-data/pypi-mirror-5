Description: The goal of ``plone.app.widgets`` is to provide an implementation for a new
        set of javascript widgets being developed in the `Plone Mockup`_ project. It
        overrides existing widgets used in dexterity and archetypes to provide tested
        and modularized widgets based on the concept of *patterns*.

          data source (with search!).*
        - Table Sorter -- *A pattern you can apply to a table so it can have its items

            Fields and widgets demo gallery
            ================================
            ``plone.app.widgets`` provides view ``@@widgets-demo`` which will render
            examples of ``zope.schema`` fields and ``plone.app.z3cform`` widgets (Dexterity).
            To see the examples go on your Plone site::
                http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@widgets-demo
            Contributing to fields and widgets gallery
            ---------------------------------------------
            External packages can add widgets to the demo by inheriting
            and registering a demo form snippet. For examples,
            see ``plone.app.widgets.demos`` source code.
