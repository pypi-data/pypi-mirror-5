        A fast and accurate part-of-speech tagger based on the Averaged Perceptron. For use with `TextBlob`_.
        
        Implementation by Matthew Honnibal, a.k.a. `syllog1sm <https://github.com/syllog1sm/>`_. Read more about it `here <http://honnibal.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/a-good-part-of-speechpos-tagger-in-about-200-lines-of-python/>`_.
        
        **NOTE**: The PerceptronTagger became a part of TextBlob core as of version 0.6.3 but will be deprecated in favor of this extension in version 0.7.0. TextBlob's extension system is in its experimental stages, as is this extension.
