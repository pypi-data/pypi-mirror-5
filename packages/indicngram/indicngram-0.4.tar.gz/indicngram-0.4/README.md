What is Ngram?
----------------

An n-gram model is a type of probabilistic model for predicting the
next item in a sequence.  n-grams are used in various areas of
statistical natural language processing and genetic sequence analysis.

An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence.  The
items in question can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base
pairs according to the application. 

An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a "unigram"; size 2 is a
"bigram" (or, less commonly, a "digram"); size 3 is a "trigram"; and
size 4 or more is simply called an "n-gram".
