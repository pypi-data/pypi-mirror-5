The agilegeo package is designed to be used as stand alone function 
defs and corresponding classes that can be used to build applications 
using the traits framework.

The core function definitions are test driven and contain the 
algorithm implementations. The class definitions wrap and abstract
the defs into Traits classes, which allows for interfacing into
traits/traitsui based applications.
