        A new type of package manager
        
        *Still under development*
        
        .. note:: This is only the library package.
        
        
        =====
        Goals
        =====
        
        Package management works but it is far from ideal. There is no simple,
        free, platform agnostic way to distribute software. I want to fix this.
        
        Enter **Packer**, a package manager built from scratch to support simple
        multiplatform software installation.
        
        It should be:
        
        * Simple
        * Extendable
        * Multiplatform (Starting with Windows, OSX, Ubuntu)
        
        
        ===========
        Installaion
        ===========
        
        Install using the following command::
        
            pip install packer
        
        
        Dependencies:
        
        * Python (must be on PATH)
        * pip
        * pywin32 (Windows)
Platform: UNKNOWN
