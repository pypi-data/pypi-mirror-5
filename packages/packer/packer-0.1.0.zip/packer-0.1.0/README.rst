Packer

A new type of package manager

*Still under development*

.. note:: This is only the library package.


=====
Goals
=====

Package management works but it is far from ideal. There is no simple,
free, platform agnostic way to distribute software. I want to fix this.

Enter **Packer**, a package manager built from scratch to support simple
multiplatform software installation.

It should be:

* Simple
* Extendable
* Multiplatform (Starting with Windows, OSX, Ubuntu)


===========
Installaion
===========

Install using the following command::

    pip install packer


Dependencies:

* Python (must be on PATH)
* pip
* pywin32 (Windows)
