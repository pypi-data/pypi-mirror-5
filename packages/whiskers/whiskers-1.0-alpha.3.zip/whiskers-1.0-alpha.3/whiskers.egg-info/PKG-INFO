Description: ========
        Whiskers
        ========
        
            "Vibrissae (singular: vibrissa), or whiskers, are specialized hairs (or, in
            certain bird species, specialized feathers) usually employed for tactile
            sensation." - Wikipedia
        
        Whiskers is a Pyramid application for storing information about your buildouts.
        It is intended to use with buildout.sendpickedversions (PyPI_, Github_)
        extension.

        Reason behind Whiskers
        ======================
        
        Why? Shortly to automate your workflow.
        
        Think an environment where you're managing tens or hundereds of buildouts - say
        Plone instances. Most of them have probably almost the same packages and 
        versions. Now you make an critical fix to some custom package and you need to
        know which buildouts you have to update. Whiskers helps you here by knowing
        what is required and where.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 or 3.3
        
        
        Pip
        ---
        
        ::
        
            virtualenv --no-site-packages -p /path/to/python whiskers
            cd whiskers
            bin/pip install whiskers
            wget https://github.com/pingviini/whiskers/raw/master/production.ini
            bin/pserve production.ini
        
        Github
        ------
        
        ::
        
            virtualenv --no-site-packages -p /path/to/python whiskers
            git clone git://github.com/pingviini/whiskers.git
            cd whiskers
            python setup.py install
            bin/pserve production.ini
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To get some data to Whiskers you should set up buildout.sendpickedversions for
        your buildouts. Just add following lines to your buildout.cfg: ::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.sendpickedversions
            send-data-url = http://localhost:6543
            ...
        
        Above configuration assumes you have Whiskers running on localhost.
        
        Run buildout and it should say in last lines something like this: ::
        
            ...
            root: Sending data to remote url (http://localhost:6543/)
            Added buildout information to Whiskers.
        
        Open web browser and go to http://localhost:6543/buildouts and you should see
        your buildout data.
        
        
        Having trouble
        ==============
        
        Both Whiskers and buildout.sendpickedversions have been updated to work
        nicely together. Make sure you are using latest version of
        buildout.sendpickedversions when you've set up Whiskers 1.x.
        
        Older version of buildout.sendpickedversions (0.x) is incompatible with
        Whiskers 1.x. Same goes to other way too - Whiskers 0.x doesn't work with
        buildout.sendpickedversions 1.x.
        
        
        Found a bug
        ===========
        
        Please kill it (or add a new issue to github). Code is out there for you.
        
        Seriously - I'm more than willing accepting new contributions.
