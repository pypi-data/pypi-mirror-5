The *master* branch on github should always contain the latest released
stable version. Development mostly happens in the *develop* branch, or
in the next point release *dev*-branch (e.g. *4.2-dev*). So please check
out the *develop* branch before starting to hack on pycarddav.

Before requesting a pull, please add yourself to *CONTRIBUTORS.txt*.
