        Usage examples
        --------------
        ::
        
            $ ufo2otf OpenBodoni.ufo
        
        will create a file called OpenBodoni.otf.
        ::
        
            $ ufo2otf OpenBodoni-Regular.ufo OpenBodoni-Italic.ufo OpenBodoni-Bold.ufo
        
        will create OpenBodoni-Regalur.otf, OpenBodoni-Italic.otf and OpenBodoni-Bold.otf.
        
        
        Fontforge
        ---------
        
        By default, ufo2otf uses FontForge to generate the otf files. FontForge is a
        free and open source font editor that comes with a python extension. The
        python extension has access to the functionality of FontForge without needing
        to launch the graphical program itself.
        
        Ufo2otf will warn you if FontForge is not present. Installing it can be as
        easy as:
        
        debian, ubuntu::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install fontforge python-fontforge
        
        os x::
        
            $ brew install fontforge
        
        More info see:
        http://openfontlibrary.org/wiki/How_to_install_FontForge
        
        AFDKO
        -----
        
        Ufo2otf can also use the AFDKO to generate the fontfiles.
        
        The Adobe Font Development Kit for Opentype are a set of tools made available
        by Adobe that can help you generate Opentype/CFF fonts from PostScript
        sources, and to add OpenType features in the progress.
        
        Since the AFDKO is not open source, and not installable on Linux, it doesn’t
        make a lot of sense for Open Source projects. But it can be useful to have
        around, if only to compare the output to that of FontForge.
        
        Please check http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html for installation
        instructions. Subsequently, one needs to install Tal Leming’s ufo2afdko
        package which in turn depends on Robofab:

        Webfonts
        --------
        
        Passing the option ``--webfonts`` will generate a subfolder called webfonts. Ufo2otf
        autohints the font and proceeds to generate ttf, eot and woff files.
        
        When using the AFDKO to convert the fonts the webfonts option is not
        available.
        
        CSS
        ---
        
        When using the ``--webfonts`` option, Ufo2otf will attempt to generate a CSS file to use
        with the generated webfonts, inspired by the service provided by the website Font Squirrel.
        However, where Font Squirrel will create a separate css @font-face family for each font
        style, Ufo2otf will try to construct your font declarations in such a way that one
        @font-face family can be used with multiple font-styles.
        
        In doing so the script is bound by what CSS supports. Currently, Ufo2otf can distinguish
        between multiple font-weights and between regular and Italic fonts. If you have other
        styles to distinguish (condensed, outline etcetera) you will need to adjust the ``font-family``
        property in the CSS to create separate families.
        
        UFO
        ---
        
        UFO is an open and exchangable format for fonts.It is easy to write programs
        that process UFO fonts, and they play well with versioning systems like Git.
