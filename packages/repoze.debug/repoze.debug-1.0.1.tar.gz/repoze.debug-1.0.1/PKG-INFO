        repoze.debug Changes
        ====================
        
        1.0.1 (2013-05-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Work around URLs which contain invalid (unquoted) characters.
        
        - Restored 100% unit test coverage.
        
        1.0 (2013-04-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for recording, logging and displaying the request body
          (thanks to Andreas Motl for the patch).
        
        1.0b1 (2013-01-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Add support for bulding docs and testing doctest snippets under ``tox``.
        
        - Add ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs Sphinx).
        
        - Add support for Python 3.2 / 3.3.
        
        - Drop support for Python 2.4 / 2.5.
        
        - Some typo fixes and enhancements to xsl stylesheet
        
        0.7.3 (2012-03-29)
        ------------------
        
        - This release is the last which will maintain support for Python 2.4 /
          Python 2.5.
        
        - Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.
        
        - Added 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs
          ``nose`` and ``coverage``).
        
        0.7.2 (2011-04-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Don't require 'threadframe' module in Python >= 2.5 (thanks, Jonathan
          Ballet).  Closes http://bugs.repoze.org/issue162.
        
        - Don't crash if unicode values are present in threads' state (thanks,
          Jonathan Ballet).  Closes http://bugs.repoze.org/issue162.
        
        0.7.1 (2010-03-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Sphinxified docs.
        
        - Don't compute tracelog records unless we are going to write them.
        
        
        0.7 (2009/09/06)
        ----------------
        
        - The iterator returned by an application was closed too soon when
          using the responselogger middleware, resulting in, e.g. errors from
          paste.fileapp complaining about "file already closed".
        
        - If the ``keep`` parameter in the "responselogger" middleware is set
          to zero, no entries are logged (not even one, as previously may have
          happened).
        
        - Better test coverage.
        
        - Ignore HTTP errors in post-mortem debug middleware. The exceptions
          we want to catch here are application-level. A configuration option
          has been added to keep the old behavior.
        
        - Added middleware "threads" to debug threads (based on an adaptation
          of Florent Guillaume's "DeadlockDebugger" product for Zope 2).
        
        0.6.2 (2008/07/03)
        ------------------
        
        - Show a "short" URL in the debug UI.
        
        0.6.1 (2008/07/03)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix debug UI bug: show escaped body regardless of content-type.
        
        0.6 (2008/07/02)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix logging bug.  Symptom: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no
          attribute 'info'
        
        0.5 (2008/06/30)
        ----------------
        
        - Make debug request id reflect approximate UNIX time rather than a
          random debug id.
        
        - Deal with responses via a generator; don't unwind response bodies
          into memory.
        
        - Default max_bodysize is now 3K rather than the entire response
          body.
        
        - User interface; keep entries around to show in GUI.  See
          /__repoze.debug/static/debugui.html.
        
        - We now write two logs: a verbose log, and a trace log.  The verbose
          log contains information about headers, request information,
          response bodies, etc.  The trace log is more compact and is written
          in essence to be parsed by a tool.
        
        - The 'filename' option in Paste config is now 'verbose_log'.
        
        - Port Zope's 'requestprofiler' script to WSGI.  Invoke via
          'wsgirequestprofiler' to see help; operates against 'trace' log.
        
        0.4 (2008/06/25)
        ----------------
        
        - Add pdbpm middleware for dropping into the post-mortem debugger upon
          an exception (copied from repoze.errorlog).
        
        0.3 (2008/06/25)
        ----------------
        
        - Add 'canary' middleware for detecting environment dictionary leaks.
          Add to your Paste config via 'egg:repoze.debug#canary'; it takes no
          arguments.  If refcounts to repoze.debug.canary.Canary grow without
          bound, you know you are leaking WSGI environment dictionaries.
        
        - Add source url to response logging.
        
        0.2 (2008/06/14)
        ----------------
        
        - Add warning if content-length != body length.
        
        0.1 (2008/06/13)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
