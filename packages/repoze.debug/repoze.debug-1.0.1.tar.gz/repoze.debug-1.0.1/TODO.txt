repoze.debug TODOs
==================

- [_] Uncaught exceptions in the downstream application are represented in
      the debug UI and trace log as "unfinished requests" (requests with
      no responses).

- [_] Flesh out coverage of the ``repoze.debug.ui`` module (requires
      refactoring to test semantic values, rather than rendered XML).
