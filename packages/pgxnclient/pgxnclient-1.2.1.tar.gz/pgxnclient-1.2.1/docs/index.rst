PGXN Client's documentation
===========================

The `PGXN Client <http://pgxnclient.projects.postgresql.org/>`__ is a command
line tool designed to interact with the `PostgreSQL Extension Network
<http://pgxn.org/>`__ allowing searching, compiling, installing, and removing
extensions in PostgreSQL databases.

For example, to install the semver_ extension, the client can be invoked as::

    $ pgxn install semver

which would download and compile the extension for one of the PostgreSQL
servers hosted on the machine and::

    $ pgxn load -d somedb semver

which would load the extension in one of the databases of the server.

The client interacts with the PGXN web service and a ``Makefile`` provided by
the extension. The best results are achieved with makefiles using the
PostgreSQL `Extension Building Infrastructure`__; however the client tries to
degrade gracefully in presence of any package hosted on PGXN and any package
available outside the extension network.
