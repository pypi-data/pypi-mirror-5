        =======
        
        A minimal Python HipChat client with command-line interface.
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        Install ``hipchav`` from source, or using ``pip``::
        
            pip install hipchav
        
        Then you'll need to configure it with your HipChat API key::
        
            export HIPCHAT_V1_TOKEN=thisismyhextokentheygaveme
        
        or for the v2 API::
        
            export HIPCHAT_V2_TOKEN=thisismyhextokentheygaveme
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        HipChav currenly only supports two functions, listing rooms and sending messages.
        
        Listing rooms
        -------------
        
        ::
        
            $ hipchav.py rooms
            Developers
            Whole company
            Bots only
        
        Sending messages
        ----------------
        
        Messages are quite straight-forward to send::
        
            $ hipchav.py message 'Whole company' 'Freshly baked cookies in the kitchen'
        
        
        You can also change their color and send notifications to people in the room::
        
            $ hipchav.py message --color=red --notify 'Developers' 'Um, the build is broken'
        
        With the v1 API, you can also choose who the message appears from::
        
            $ hipchav.py message --from=Glados 'Whole company' 'Dispensing deadly neurotoxin'
        
        Check its usage information for full options::
        
            $ hipchav.py --help
