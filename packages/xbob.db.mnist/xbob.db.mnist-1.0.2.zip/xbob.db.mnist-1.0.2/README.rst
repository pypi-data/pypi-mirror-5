 MNIST Database
================

The MNIST database is a database of handwritten digits, which consists of a
training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It was 
made available by Yann Le Cun and Corinna Cortes (`MNIST database 
<http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`_). The data was originally extracted 
from a larger set made available by `NIST <http://www.nist.gov/>`_, before 
being size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image (28x28 pixels).

The actual raw data for the database should be downloaded from the `original
website <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`_. This package only contains 
the `Bob <http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/>`_ accessor methods to use this
database directly from python.

You would normally not install this package unless you are maintaining it. What
you would do instead is to tie it in at the package you need to **use** it.
There are a few ways to achieve this:

1. You can add this package as a requirement at the ``setup.py`` for your own
   `satellite package
   <https://github.com/idiap/bob/wiki/Virtual-Work-Environments-with-Buildout>`_
   or to your Buildout ``.cfg`` file, if you prefer it that way. With this
   method, this package gets automatically downloaded and installed on your
   working environment, or

2. You can manually download and install this package using commands like
   ``easy_install`` or ``pip``.

The package is available in two different distribution formats:

1. You can download it from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.db.mnist>`_, or

2. You can download it in its source form from `its git repository
   <https://github.com/bioidiap/xbob.db.mnist>`_. 

The database raw files must be installed somewhere in your environment.

You can mix and match points 1/2 above based on your requirements. Here
are some examples:

Modify your setup.py and download from PyPI
===========================================

That is the easiest. Edit your ``setup.py`` in your satellite package and add
the following entry in the ``install_requires`` section (note: ``...`` means
`whatever extra stuff you may have in-between`, don't put that on your
script)::

    install_requires=[
      ...
      "xbob.db.mnist",
    ],

Proceed normally with your ``bootstrap/buildout`` steps and you should be all
set. That means you can now import the namespace ``xbob.db.mnist`` into your scripts.

Modify your buildout.cfg and download from git
==============================================

You will need to add a dependence to `mr.developer
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer/>`_ to be able to install from our
git repositories. Your ``buildout.cfg`` file should contain the following
lines::

  [buildout]
  ...
  extensions = mr.developer
  auto-checkout = *
  eggs = bob
         ...
         xbob.db.mnist

  [sources]
  xbob.db.mnist = git https://github.com/bioidiap/xbob.db.mnist.git
  ...


How to use this database API
============================

After launching the python interpreter (assuming that the environment is properly set up),
you could get the training set as follows::

  >>> import xbob.db.mnist
  >>> db = xbob.db.mnist.Database('PATH_TO_DATA_FROM_YANN_LECUN_WEBSITE') # 4 binary .gz compressed files
  >>> images, labels = db.data(groups='train', labels=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])

In this case, this should return two NumPy arrays:

1. `images` contain the raw data (60,000 samples of dimension 784 [28x28 pixels images])

2. `labels` are the corresponding classes (digits 0 to 9) for each of the 60,000 samples


If you don't have the data installed on your machine, you can also use the following 
set of commands that will:

1. first look for the database in the xbob/db/mnist/ subdirectory and use it if is available

2. or automatically download it from Yann Lecun's website into a temporary folder, that will
be erased when the destructor of the xbob.db.mnist database is called.

::

  >>> import xbob.db.mnist
  >>> db = xbob.db.mnist.Database() # Check for the data files locally, and download them if required
  >>> images, labels = db.data(groups='train', labels=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
  >>> del db # delete the temporary downloaded files if any
