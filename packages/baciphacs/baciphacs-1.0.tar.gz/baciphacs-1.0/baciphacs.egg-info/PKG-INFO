        =========
        
        Bar charts in pure HTML and CSS.
        
        This library is designed for the kind of (desesperate) situation where
        you want to display bar charts but with the constraint that your HTML
        document must not depend on additional files or remote webservices.
        
        baciphacs will use basic HTML code with some bits of CSS style embeded
        in tags, to display a reasonably readable chart.
        
        If you need pretty or advanced graphs and don't have any strict
        constraints on your HTML's dependency, many libraries exists that
        generate much much better looking graphs.

        It is tested on Travis-CI: [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/tibonihoo/baciphacs.png?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/tibonihoo/baciphacs) 
        
        
        Example for horizontal bar charts
        ---------------------------------
        
        ```python
        from baciphacs import DataSample
        from baciphacs import GenerateHTMLHorizontalBarChart
        
        data = [("ba",3,2),("c",6,1),("i",2,1),("p",4,1),("h",4,1),("a",3,1),("cs",3,2)]
        dataSamples = [DataSample._make(t) for t in data]
        print GenerateHTMLHorizontalBarChart(dataSamples,numStdev=2,color="blue")
        ```
        
        The Python code above will generate an HTML snippet that [renders like a bar chart](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tibonihoo/baciphacs/blob/master/doc/index.html).
