Description: ==================
        django-signedforms
        ==================
        
        A small library that provides a form class that signs a configurable set of
        hidden fields using ``django.core.signing``.
        
        The most common use case for such a form is when the view that handles the post
        differs from the view that sets up the form, but you need to pass some
        information from one view to the other, without evil hackers tampering with your
        precious data.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Subclass SignedForm, and define which fields should be signed::
        
            from signedforms.forms import SignedForm
        
            class MyForm(SignedForm):
                signed_fields = ['redirect_url',]
        
                redirect_url = forms.CharField(required=False, widget=forms.HiddenInput)
        
        In the form that sets up the view, provide the data to be signed in the
        ``initial`` dictionary::
        
            my_form = MyForm(initial={'redirect_url': self.request.path_info})
        
        and in the view that handles the posted form::
        
            def form_valid(self, form):
                # do some work
                return HttpResponseRedirect(form.cleaned_data['redirect_url'])
        
        .. note::
        
            If the user tampered with the hidden data, the form will not validate.
        
        .. warning::
        
            Only fields that contain JSON-serializable data can be signed. This includes
            all fields that are represented as text in the database, but not datetimes
            and other more "complex" types.
