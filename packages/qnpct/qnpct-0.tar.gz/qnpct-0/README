qnpct
-----

A simple module to ease testing numerical code in C with NumPy arrays
via ctypes.

For the moment, it consists of a context manager that takes a set of
arrays as keyword arguments, and exposes stable pointers as attributes
to be used in the context.

It also imports all of ctpyes & numpy.
