tiddlywebplugins.ibuilder is a tool to help build instance packages.

In TiddlyWeb, an instance package provides pre-defined tiddlers,
bags, and recipes for a plugin.

ibuilder replaces the development half of the functionality
provided by tiddlywebplugins.instancer. See tiddlywebplugins.imaker
for the other half.
