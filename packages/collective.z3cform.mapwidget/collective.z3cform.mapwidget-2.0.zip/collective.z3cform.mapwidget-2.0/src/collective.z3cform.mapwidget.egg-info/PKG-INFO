        - Execute map construction on window.load rather than when the JavaScript
          gets loaded.
          [davidjb]
        - Pass map id through to edit shape map JavaScript.
          [davidjb]
        - Remove dependency on jq object for edit shape map.
          [davidjb]
        - Added ability to display a collective.geo map when outputting this widget
