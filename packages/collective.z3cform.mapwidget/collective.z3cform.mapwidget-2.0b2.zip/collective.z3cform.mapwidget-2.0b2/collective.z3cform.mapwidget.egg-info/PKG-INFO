        ----------------

        - Restructure geocoder JavaScript so it happens on window.load (and wrap
          the usage of ``$``).
          [davidjb]
        - Execute map construction on window.load rather than when the JavaScript
          gets loaded.
          [davidjb]
        - Pass map id through to edit shape map JavaScript.
          [davidjb]
        - Remove dependency on jq object for edit shape map.
          [davidjb]
        - Added ability to display a collective.geo map when outputting this widget
          in display mode.  Presents a layer with the field's value as its features.
