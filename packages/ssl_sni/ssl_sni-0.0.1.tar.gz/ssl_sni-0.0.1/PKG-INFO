        ssl_sni
        =======
        
        ssl_sni provides a module similar to the Python 2.7 builtin module ssl with the
        Server Name Indication (SNI) extension. In particular the wrap_socket function
        has the extra parameter **server_hostname** to provide a hostname via SNI to
        the server.
        
        ssl_sni is built on top of the pyOpenSSL and pyasn1 modules. In other words it
        is a pure python module that does not make any calls directly (not through
        pyOpenSSL) to the OpenSSL.
        
        For now the subset of the ssl module provided is that required by mercurial and
        httpplus (used by mercurial). If you have requests for specific other features
        please file a bug.
