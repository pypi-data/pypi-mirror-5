ssl_sni
=======

ssl_sni provides a module similar to the Python 2.7 builtin module ssl with the
Server Name Indication (SNI) extension. In particular the wrap_socket function
has the extra parameter **server_hostname** to provide a hostname via SNI to
the server.

ssl_sni is built on top of the pyOpenSSL and pyasn1 modules. In other words it
is a pure python module that does not make any calls directly (not through
pyOpenSSL) to the OpenSSL.

For now the subset of the ssl module provided is that required by mercurial and
httpplus (used by mercurial). If you have requests for specific other features
please file a bug.
