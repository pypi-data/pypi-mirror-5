Great Circle Maps for Python
============================

This is a Python rewrite of the code used to create the `Visualizing Facebook Friends <http://fbmap.bitaesthetics.com/>`__ visualization in 2010.

The original code was written in R and was built specifically around the Facebook dataset. This rewrite is as a Python module and is built to work on top of any dataset.

If you are looking to visualize a few (<10,000) coordinate pairs, `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ with `basemap <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`__ will be more flexible. The visualization
implemented by this module is useful when the data alone are sufficient to show the geography.

The algorithm uses a heuristic which attempts to visualize the *structure* of the pairs rather than their relative importance. In interpreting the results, you should not come to any conclusions about the relative importance of different coordinate pairs.

Installation
------------

You can install ``gcmaps`` with ``pip``::

    # pip install gcmaps

Usage
-----

The module supplies two classes, ``GCMapper`` and ``Gradient``. ``GCMapper`` is the main class for rendering great-circle maps. ``Gradient`` is used when you would like to customize the color gradient
used to render the map.

``GCmapper``
------------

First, import GCMapper and instantiate it::

    >>> from gcmap import GCMapper
    >>> gcm = GCMapper()

The ``GCMapper()`` constructor can take a number of arguments:

* ``width`` the height of the output image
* ``height`` the width of the output image; defaults to half the width, which fits the world completely for the default projection (equidistant cylindrical)
* ``bgcol`` the background color as an (r, g, b) triple, eg. (255, 0, 0) for red
* ``cols`` a ``Gradient`` object or other function from a fraction an (r, g, b) triple
* ``proj`` the projection to use as a string, passed to pyproj. See `pyprj <http://pyproj.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/pyproj-pysrc.html>`__ for a list of projections
* ``line_width`` the width of the lines draw, in pixels
* ``gc_resolution`` the number of straight line segments used to approximate each great-circle curve

Normally you would load the coordinate pairs from a file. For this example I'll simply code in the
data::

    >>> lons1 = [-79.4, -73.9, -122.4, -123.1, -0.1  ]
    >>> lats1 = [ 43.7,  40.7,   37.8,   49.2,  51.5 ]
    >>> lons2 = lons1[1:] + lons1[:1]    # this creates a cycle through the points
    >>> lats2 = lats1[1:] + lats1[:1]

The data can also be a numpy array.

Then, give the data to the ``GCMapper`` instance::

    >>> gcm.set_data(lons1, lats1, lons2, lats2)

Now, we can generate the image::

    >>> img = gcm.draw()

``img`` is just a Python Image Library Image object, which we can save in any supported
format::

    >>> img.save('output.png')

``Gradient``
------------

Gradients are instantiated with one parameter, a list of two or more gradient "stops". Stops
are RGB colors located at a fractional position along the gradient. The color at any point
on the gradient is a weighted blend of the stops nearest to that point in either direction.

For example, let's define a gradient from white to red to black::

    >>> from gcmap import Gradient
    >>> #             (stop,   red, green,  blue)
    >>> g = Gradient([(   0,   255,   255,   255),
    ...               ( 0.4,   255,     0,     0),
    ...               (   1,     0,     0,     0)])

Note that red the stop is at 0.4, or four tenths of the gradient.

The gradient ``g`` now acts as a function when it is called. When it is called with a
stop which was explicitly specified at construction, it returns the (r, g, b) triple
at that stop::

    >>> g(0)
    (255, 255, 255)
    >>> g(0.4)
    (255, 0, 0)
    >>> g(1)
    (0, 0, 0)

When ``g`` is called with fractions that are not stops, it blends the nearest stops in
either direction to create a new color::

    >>> g(0.1)
    (255, 191, 191)
    >>> g(0.2)
    (255, 127, 127)
    >>> g(0.3)
    (255, 63, 63)
    >>> g(0.5)
    (212, 0, 0)
    >>> g(0.6)
    (170, 0, 0)
    >>> g(0.7)
    (127, 0, 0)
    >>> g(0.8)
    (84, 0, 0)
    >>> g(0.9)
    (42, 0, 0)
