Description: pyroute2
        ========
        
        Python netlink library. The main goal of the project is to
        implement complete NETLINK\_ROUTE family as well as several
        other families (NETLINK\_NETFILTER etc.)
        
        Current feature status see in STATUS.md
        
        sample
        ------
        
        More samples you can read in the project documentation.
        Low-level interface::
        
            from pyroute2 import IPRoute
        
            # get access to the netlink socket
            ip = IPRoute()
        
            # print interfaces
            print ip.get_links()
        
            # stop working with netlink and release all sockets
            ip.release()
        
        High-level transactional interface, IPDB:
        
            from pyroute2 import IPDB
            # local network settings
            ip = IPDB()
            # create bridge and add ports and addresses
            # transaction will be started with `with` statement
            # and will be committed at the end of the block
            with ip.create(kind='bridge', ifname='rhev') as i:
                i.add_port(ip.em1)
                i.add_port(ip.em2)
                i.add_ip('10.0.0.2/24')
        
        
        The project contains several modules for different types of
        netlink messages, not only RTNL.
