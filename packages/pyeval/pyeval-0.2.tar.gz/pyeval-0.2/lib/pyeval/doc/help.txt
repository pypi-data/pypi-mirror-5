The 'help' binding is an instance of HelpBrowser, which can either
be used to display pyeval help topics, or can be used similar to the
'pydoc.help' instance in the python standard library.

To view pyeval help topics, evaluate 'help' with the topic as the first
argument.  For example:

    $ pyeval help topics
    ...

To examine source docstrings any object, such as a class, pass it to help
as a function:

    $ pyeval 'help(BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer)'
    ...

There is a special case for AutoImporter module proxies, so that the
original module is passed on to the pydoc help system:

    $ pyeval 'help(BaseHTTPServer)'
    ...

To use the interactive help system of pydoc, call it directly:

    $ pyeval 'pydoc.help()'
    ...
