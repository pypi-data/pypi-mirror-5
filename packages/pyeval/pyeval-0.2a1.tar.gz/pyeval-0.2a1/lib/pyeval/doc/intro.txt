Usage: pyeval EXPR [ARG...]

Evaluate EXPR with the python interpreter.  Any other ARGs are available
as strings in the expression.  Example:

    $ pyeval 'a0.split("-")' hello-world
    ['hello', 'world']

Evaluation differs from the interactive interpreter in three ways:
result display, magic variables, and automatic imports.

The result is displayed with pprint.pprint, unless it is None, in which
case nothing is displayed.

There are "magic variables" whose result is only computed on the first
dereference.

Any reference which is not a standard builtin or a magic variable results
in an AutoImporter instance, which this example demonstrates by importing
'math':

    $ pyeval 'math.cos(math.pi * 2)'
    1.0

To explore further topics evaluate help with the first arugment as the
topic name.  Start with:

    $ pyeval help topics
    ...

NOTE: If you used pyeval 0.1.6 or older, please run

    $ pyeval help upgrading
    ...
