Description: Bastio Agent
        ============
        
        Bastio is an operating system user account provisioning tool to help
        people with a lot of servers and users create and delete system user accounts.
        With Bastio, you no longer need to keep track of your team's access to
        servers. For example, once a team member leaves, you can disable her access to
        all your server assets in one click.
        
        Bastio saves you time by not making you wait for your team members to generate
        and send you their public keys; team members can upload their existing
        public key. Crypto-savvy members of your team are still free to
        generate their own.
        
        Install |project_name| on your servers to enable OS account provisioning and SSH
        access management. No daunting configurations needed; all you have to do is specify
        your API key and run the agent.
