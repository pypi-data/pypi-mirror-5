        Easier migration from Boostrap 2 to Boostrap 3
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        This is a simple Python script that replaces certain strings in the files
        contained within the working directory and its subdirectories. It does not fully
        automate migration, you'll most likely need to perform manual fixes too.
        
        Follow these steps to avoid frustration:
        ----------------------------------------
        
        * Put your HTML/template files under version control, if they aren't yet.
        * Change to the directory with the files containing Boostrap 2 specific markup.
        * Run this script once and only once.
        * Review the changes with a diff tool suitable for the version control system you use.
        * Perform the rest of the necessary changes manually.
