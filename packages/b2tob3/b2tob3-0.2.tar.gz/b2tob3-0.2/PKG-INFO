Description: b2tob3
        ======
        
        Easier migration from Boostrap 2 to Boostrap 3
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        b2tob3 is a command line tool to help migrate Web projects from bootstrap 2
        to bootstrap 3 by performing a set of replacements that reflect bootstrap 3
        class name changes.
        
        By default b2tob3 searches all files in the current directory and its
        subdirectories. Use the comman line options to set the working and limit
        to a file extension.
        
        b2tob3 does not fully automate migration, but it takes away some of the tedious
        work. Still, you'll most likely need to perform manual fixes too.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install b2tob3
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            cd /project/html/
            b2tob3
        
        Follow these steps to avoid frustration:
        ----------------------------------------
        
        * Put your HTML/template files under version control, if they aren't yet.
        * Change to the directory with the files containing Boostrap 2 specific markup.
        * Run the b2tob3 script once and only once.
        * Review the changes with a diff tool suitable for the version control system you use.
        * Perform the rest of the necessary changes manually.
