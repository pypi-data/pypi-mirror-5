        surrealism module for Python
        ----------------------------
        
        
        This module allows you to generate surreal sentences and error messages very easily from within your python programs.  
        
        
        This module is a derivative work (used with permission) from www.ravenblack.net.  
        
        
        Credit also goes to Kevan Davis on whose work the surrealism generator at www.ravenblack.net is based on.
