        ===========
        There was a wiki bot, so I decided to create also b wiki bot.
        
        After installation run command bwikibot, and you should see something like this:
        
        | write             - Read text from stdio and save to page with name passed in param
        | cybwiki_stop_spam - Block spammers and delete their creations on cybwiki
        | endpoint          - Change endpoing but don't change cookies (for wiki families)
        | throttle          - Set or get delay between queries
        | read              - Print page which's name passed in param to stdout
        | autocomplete      - Print list of page names which starts from passed prefix
        | check_uploads     - Check and mark new files for licensing issues,
        |                       and send messages to uploaders.
        | logout            - Delete session file
