        Overview
        ========
        
        This is a basic Django application implementing the simplest form of a
        blogging system. It's able to handle multible blogs and users.
        It has been written with an eye put on keeping modularity and flexibility as
        much as possible, so you won't find lots of goodies in the code (tagging,
        related posts, blogroll), but just a couple of features to help you start
        hacking it to your needs.

        configuration and customization instructions.
