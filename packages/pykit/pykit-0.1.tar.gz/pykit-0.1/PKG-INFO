Description: pykit
        =====
        
        Backend compiler for high-level typed code with first-class support for
        multi-dimensional arrays, list tuples and dicts. High-level operations
        are optimized and must be lowered to a runtime implementation. Provided
        runtime implementations are in place for memory management and garbage
        collection, exceptions and threads.
        
        Pykit tries to address an ever-growing number of compilers in the Python
        community, with a focus on array-oriented numerical code.
        
        pykit:
        
            * lowers and optimizes intermediate code
            * produces IR that can be mapped to any desired runtime
            * tries to be independent from platform or high-level language
            * can generate LLVM or C89 out of the box
        
        pykit is inspired by VMKit and LLVM.
