Changes
-------

0.2.0 (2013-06-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an initial release to accommodate demand for basic SDC API v7.0 features. Further work is to come, so the API and features are to be considered unstable and in flux.

* Support SmartDC API Version 7.0 by default
* Add legacy mode for places where version 6.5 calls are necessary -- calling a v7.0 machine in v6.5 mode will lead to unexpected results.
* Added list/get networks, list/get images methods
* Support new REST API-level filtering for listing packages and images
* ``create_machine()`` now accepts a network parameter
* Eliminated the previously-deprecated ``DataCenter(config=)`` parameter

0.1.13 (2013-06-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Changes to allow for connections to vmwebadm hubs
* Be resilient to IP addresses not being present immediately on creation
* Adapt documentation to allow for late v6.5 API deployment changes

0.1.12 (2013-01-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Telefónica has updated the endpoints for its known locations. These locations are capable of SSL-verifiable connections.
* Move print statements in library to print functions (still pending issue with versioneer)
* Requests 1.0 release removed ``config`` from request's keyword arguments, so created a workaround that works in old and new versions
* ``verbose`` (bool) is now the preferred keyword argument in DataCenter initialization since we no longer piggy-back on requests config. ``config`` issues a warning.

0.1.11 (2012-12-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Minor update to the README quickstart
* Machines are hashable based on their UUIDs
* Pre-programmed Telefónica locations are based on FQDNs
* KNOWN ISSUE: DataCenter equality not guaranteed with Telefónica servers (due to how they are identified by Telefónica)

0.1.10 (2012-11-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* This version accommodates communication with Telefónica's InstantServers service
* Change documentation to account for underlying shift in py-http-signature accommodating both (new) paramiko and ssh
* Add "verify" option to DataCenter to allow for opt-out of SSL Certificate verification (necessitated by Telefónica's initial release of InstantServers)
* Save more state from current DataCenter when transferring to another one
* Be a little more resourceful in resolving a DataCenter.datacenter() argument by name

0.1.9 (2012-10-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Bug fix: POSTs including data would get mangled while looking for a correct ssh-agent key (thanks, @thekad)
* Bug fix: ssh-agent would throw wrong error if it failed to find any keys
* Set `allow-agent` to False by default, thanks in part to this less-explored code path

0.1.8 (2012-05-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Bug fix: double-json encoding on add_key got in way of proper upload
* Introduce python-versioneer to hopefully make version management more palatable

0.1.7 (2012-05-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Renamed metadata_dict and tag_dict parameters to metadata and tags
* POST data as JSON, rather than encoded in URL
* Added boot_script option on machine creation
* Process and expose credentials
* Slight tutorial and other documentation cleanup
* Local filtering on datasets and packages

0.1.6 (2012-04-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed release issues (README)
* Moved long tutorial out of the README
* Integrated with ``ssh-agent`` changes in ``http_signature``
