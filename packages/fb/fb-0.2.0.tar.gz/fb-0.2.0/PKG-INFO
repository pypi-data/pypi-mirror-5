Description: **************************************************************
        *Python Sdk for the Facebook Graph Api. (Supports python 2.X)*
        **************************************************************
        
        | **fb** is a python sdk for the Facebook Graph Api. The sdk provides three methods 
        | for interacting largely with facebook. publish(), get_object() and delete()
        | 
        | **sudo pip install fb**
        |
        
        
        *1. Publishing to Facebook*
        ===========================
        | For publishing, use the publish() method.  Publishing means creating objects like:
        | a wall post, a like, events and albums, etc. Currently photo upload
        | is not supported. At `developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/ <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/>`_
        | under **'Other  Objects'**, see list of publish categories except "photos".
        
        ====================================
         *Examples*
        ====================================
        |    import fb    
        |    # Go to `developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer <http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer>`_ to generate test token
        |    token="*the facebook token you are going to use*"
        |    facebook=fb.graph.api(token)
        |    
        |    *#Post on the current user's wall*
        |    facebook.publish(cat="feed", id="me", message="My faecbook status")
        |     
        |    *#Like an object(wall post, photo and anything thats likable in facebook) with id=object_id*
        |    facebook.publish(cat="likes", id=object_id)
        |
        |    *#Comment on an objects thats commentable*
        |    facebook.publish(cat="comments", id=object_id, message="My comment")
        |
        |    *#Create an album*
        |    facebook.publish(cat="albums", id="me", name="Album Name", message="Album Details")
        |
        |    *Create an event*
        |    facebook.publish(cat="events", id="me", name="My Event", start_time="2013-10-16-12:20", end_time="2013-10-18-14:30" )
        
        *Important*
        -----------
        |    In addition to 'cat' (the category)  and 'id', publish takes any parameter thats
        |    valid for the publish category(cat). Like "message" for wall post, "name" for albums, 
        |    nothing for likes, etc. Check facebook doc for full list of valid parameters 
        |    for each kind of publishing. If you find that a parameter is raising error, 
        |    it maybe because this sdk does not yet support the parameter,please report such cases 
        |    to the author.
        
        *2. Fetch Objects from Facebook*
        ================================
        
        | Objects can be fetched in two ways using the get_object() method. 
        | Fetch "single" object with  it's given "fields"  passed in a list.
        | Or retrieve "multiple" objects passed with their "ids" in a list.
        
        =============================================
        *Examples*
        =============================================
        |    *#Retrieve given fields for a single object*
        |    object=facebook.get_object(cat="single", id=object_id, fields=["name", "email" ] )
        |
        |    *#Retrieve ALL fields for a single object*
        |    object=facebook.get_object(cat="single", id=object_id, fields=[ ] )
        |
        |    *#Rertieve multiple objects*
        |    object=facebook.get_object(cat="multiple", ids=['zuck', 'me'] )
        
        *3. Delete Objects*
        ===================
        
        | Deleting objects is simple. use the delete method and pass the id of the
        | object to be deleted. But, in case of deleting a "LIKE", you have to
        | pass the id of the object liked and the category of the delete which is "likes".
        
        =============================================
        *Examples*
        =============================================
        | *#Delete a status*
        | fb.delete(id=status_id)
        |
        | *#Delete a comment*
        | fb.delete(id=comment_id)
        |
        | *#Delete a "LIKE"*
        | #fb.delete(cat="likes", id=object_id)
