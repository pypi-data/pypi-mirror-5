Description: OiRA is a comprehensive, easy to use and cost-free web application. It helps
        micro and small organisations to put in place a thorough step-by-step risk
        assessment process - from the identification and evaluation of workplace risks,
        through decision making on preventive actions and the completion of these
        actions, to continued monitoring and reporting.
        
        With a potential audience of some 20 million micro and small organisations
        throughout the European Union (EU27), OiRA has a key role to play in making
        Europe a safer and healthier place to work and by doing so, supporting the
        goals of the European Community Strategy for Health and Safety at Work
        2007-2012.
        
        This package contains customisations on top of the standard `Euphorie
        <http://packages.python.org/Euphorie>`_ application as used for the OSHA-OIRA
        website.
