EEA Versions is a versioning system based on a version ID to group certains
objects and EffectiveDate to determine version number.

.. note ::

  This add-on doesn't do anything by itself. It needs to be integrated by a
  developer within your own products. For reference you can check
  the `eea.sparql`_ package.

Installation
============

zc.buildout
-----------
If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Update your buildout.cfg file:

  * Add ``eea.versions`` to the list of eggs to install
  * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug

  ::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
      ...
      eea.versions

    zcml =
      ...
      eea.versions

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

  $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
