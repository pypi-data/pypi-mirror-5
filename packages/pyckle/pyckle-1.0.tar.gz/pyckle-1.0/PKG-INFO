Description: Pyckle is for Python the same as JSON for Javascript,
            the serialization format. It aims to bypass the JSON's limitations, like
            the poor set of builtin objects. So it does support all fancy python
            builtin datatypes like sets or complex numbers as well as few usefull types
            from standard library like fractions.Fraction.
