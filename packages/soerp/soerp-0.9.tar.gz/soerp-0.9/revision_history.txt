soerp-0.8.2
===========

- Modified 'error_components' method so that if 'pprint=True', nothing is 
  returned.

- Added pickling functionality (an object's before and after counterparts are
  not yet correlated, but objects unpickled together maintain prior 
  correlations)

- Updated display of class objects from "UF(...)" and "UV(...)" to simply 
  "uv(...)" for both and created an auxiliary method "describe" to provide a
  textual explanation of the distribution moments (i.e., "Mean...", 
  "Variance...", etc.)

- Corrected a bug in the "error_components" method that caused the cross-product
  components to point to the linear components

- Removed "raw2central" utility function from being imported automatically since
  it is mostly used in internal calculations anyway.

- Added more documentation to class methods/functions

- Added ``covariance_matrix`` and ``correlation_matrix`` methods.
