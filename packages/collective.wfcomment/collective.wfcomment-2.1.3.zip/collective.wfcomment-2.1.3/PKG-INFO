        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package installs a JavaScript handler (using jQuery) that will present
        a prompt box inviting the user to enter a comment before triggering a workflow
        transition from the 'state' drop-down in a standard Plone site.
        
        The handler will only be used for workflow actions using the standard
        `content_status_modify` script.
        
        You can restrict this behaviour on some transitions through a control panel.
        
        You can make the comment required or not.

        collective.wfcomment Installation
        ---------------------------------
        
        To install collective.wfcomment into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
          ``easy_install collective.wfcomment``. Find out how to install setuptools
          (and EasyInstall) here:
          http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * Create a file called ``collective.wfcomment-configure.zcml`` in the
          ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
          should only contain this::
        
            <include package="collective.wfcomment" />
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``collective.wfcomment`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.wfcomment
               
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                collective.wfcomment
              
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
