Description: ======
        Sprout
        ======
        
        This is a common Python library which contains reusable components,
        developed at Infrae.
        
        Sprout, while mainly XML related, does not have a functional goal as
        such. Its goals instead are organizational:
        
        * Enable code reuse between projects, such as Silva and Infrae's
          topicmaps implementation
        
        * Allow us to write modern, pure Python code without external
          dependencies -- it only depends on the Python standard library.
        
        * Allow us to write solid code, covered by a large unit test
          suite. The lack of external dependencies and focus on modern code
          makes this easier.
        
        While Sprout's aim is mainly for use within Infrae at present, the
        code inside should be general enough for use in your own projects as
        well.
        
        Sprout's focus is mainly currently XML related. It features:
        
        * ``sprout.saxext``, a library to make writing SAX-based code more
          easy.
        
        * ``htmlsubset``, a system to easily create HTML-ish subsets that are
          secure and robust to wrong user input.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.1.1 (23/05/2013)
        ------------------
        
        * Improve sprout.saxext xmlimport ``getData`` and ``clearData`` that
          wipe all data associated with the importer in one pass.
        
        1.1 (05/03/2013)
        ----------------
        
        Improve sprout.saxext xmlimport and xmlexport classes:
        
        * To make available user-defined options to the handlers. Those
          options have to be defined with the help of ``registerOption``
          before being usuable.
        
        * To support work on temporary files and already opened files. This is
          more efficient on large import and export, and prevent to create
          large ``StringIO`` objects.
        
        
        Every piece of code using those classes will need to be updated to
        work with this new version.
        
        1.0.5 (03/09/2012)
        ------------------
        
        * Add two misisng methods for prefix mapping on the handler, in order
          to follow the SAX handler.
        
        * The xmlexport handler takes now arguments and keyword arguments that
          it passes along to child handlers.
        
        1.0.4 (07/11/2011)
        ------------------
        
        * Add a missing method characters to xmlexport handler, in order to
          follow the SAX protocol.
        
        1.0.3 (15/07/2010)
        ------------------
        
        * Remove deprecated silvasubset,
        
        * Add support to register producers with adapters,
        
        * saxify as now a validate option to verify the validity of the incoming
          XML to work on before doing anything,
        
        * Update and clean tests.
        
        
        1.0.2 (03/11/2009)
        ------------------
        
        * Fix thread safety in xml importer.
        
        1.0.1 (05/10/2009)
        ------------------
        
        * Use builtin set instead of the deprecated sets module (when available).
        
        1.0 (25/09/2008)
        ----------------
        
        * Package extension as an egg.
        
        0.9
        ---
        
        * When title attributes are added to ``<a>`` tags, they are now
          recognized but nothing is done with them.  Previously, the presence
          of a 'title' attribute corrupted the link.
        
        0.8
        ---
        
        * no changes logged.
        
        0.7
        ---
        
        * Added support for hex entities (e.g. ``&#xa0;`` for a non-breaking
          space) ``to html2sax``.
        
        * Added support for *limiting* HTML, taking safe, well-formed snippets
          out of larger HTML strings. Can deal with HTML that is not
          well-formed.
        
        0.6.2
        -----
        
        * set sprout up as a Python package in a much simpler, and less wrong
          way.
        
        0.6.1
        -----
        
        * ``sax2html`` handles empty attributes in HTML now, so that ``<option
          selected>`` gets turned into ``<option selected="selected">``.
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        * in Silva subset, accept nested ``<b>``, ``<i>`` and ``<a href="">``
          in those.
        
        * Allow optional filtering handler that events get passed through before
          import happens.
         
        0.5.1
        -----
        
        * In silva subset, treat ``\n`` as ``<br>``.
        
        * In ``html2sax``, we're now making sure that any tags that cannot be
          singletons in HTML are kept open, by adding an extra space character
          event.
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        * Initial public release.
