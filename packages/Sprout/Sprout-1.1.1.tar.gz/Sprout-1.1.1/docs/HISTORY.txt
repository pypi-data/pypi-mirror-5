Changes
=======

1.1.1 (23/05/2013)
------------------

* Improve sprout.saxext xmlimport ``getData`` and ``clearData`` that
  wipe all data associated with the importer in one pass.

1.1 (05/03/2013)
----------------

Improve sprout.saxext xmlimport and xmlexport classes:

* To make available user-defined options to the handlers. Those
  options have to be defined with the help of ``registerOption``
  before being usuable.

* To support work on temporary files and already opened files. This is
  more efficient on large import and export, and prevent to create
  large ``StringIO`` objects.


Every piece of code using those classes will need to be updated to
work with this new version.

1.0.5 (03/09/2012)
------------------

* Add two misisng methods for prefix mapping on the handler, in order
  to follow the SAX handler.

* The xmlexport handler takes now arguments and keyword arguments that
  it passes along to child handlers.

1.0.4 (07/11/2011)
------------------

* Add a missing method characters to xmlexport handler, in order to
  follow the SAX protocol.

1.0.3 (15/07/2010)
------------------

* Remove deprecated silvasubset,

* Add support to register producers with adapters,

* saxify as now a validate option to verify the validity of the incoming
  XML to work on before doing anything,

* Update and clean tests.


1.0.2 (03/11/2009)
------------------

* Fix thread safety in xml importer.

1.0.1 (05/10/2009)
------------------

* Use builtin set instead of the deprecated sets module (when available).

1.0 (25/09/2008)
----------------

* Package extension as an egg.

0.9
---

* When title attributes are added to ``<a>`` tags, they are now
  recognized but nothing is done with them.  Previously, the presence
  of a 'title' attribute corrupted the link.

0.8
---

* no changes logged.

0.7
---

* Added support for hex entities (e.g. ``&#xa0;`` for a non-breaking
  space) ``to html2sax``.

* Added support for *limiting* HTML, taking safe, well-formed snippets
  out of larger HTML strings. Can deal with HTML that is not
  well-formed.

0.6.2
-----

* set sprout up as a Python package in a much simpler, and less wrong
  way.

0.6.1
-----

* ``sax2html`` handles empty attributes in HTML now, so that ``<option
  selected>`` gets turned into ``<option selected="selected">``.

0.6
---

* in Silva subset, accept nested ``<b>``, ``<i>`` and ``<a href="">``
  in those.

* Allow optional filtering handler that events get passed through before
  import happens.
 
0.5.1
-----

* In silva subset, treat ``\n`` as ``<br>``.

* In ``html2sax``, we're now making sure that any tags that cannot be
  singletons in HTML are kept open, by adding an extra space character
  event.

0.5
---

* Initial public release.
