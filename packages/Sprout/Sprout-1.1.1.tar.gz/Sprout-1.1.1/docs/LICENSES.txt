Sprout is copyright Infrae and distributed under the BSD license (see
docs/licenses/BSD.txt), with the following exceptions:

test.py, the test-runner script, is GPL and copyright Shuttleworth
Foundation. See doc/licenses/GPL.txt. It is believed the unchanged
inclusion of test.py to run the unit test suite falls under the
"aggregation" clause of the GPL and thus does not affect the license
of the rest of the package.

sprout.tagfilter contains regular expressions from the HTMLParser
module in the Python standard library. sprout.saxext.generator is an
improved version of the generator in the Python standard
library. These are copyright PSF and come under the Python license,
detailed in docs/licenses/PythonLicense.txt.
