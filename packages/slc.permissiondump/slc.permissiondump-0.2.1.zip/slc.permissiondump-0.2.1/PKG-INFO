Description: slc.permissiondump
        ==================
        
        Walk the Plone portal and dump the list of local roles for each item. Then
        go through the dump and generate a nice HTML visualization of the tree of
        items with their assigned local roles.
        
        
        INSTALL
        =======
        
        Add this egg to buildout's egg list and run the buildout.
        
        
        USAGE
        =====
        
        For usage description run the following::
        
            $ bin/instance dump_roles --help
        
        To dump roles to a file, run the following::
        
            $ bin/instance dump_roles --output-dir OUTDIR --portal-name PORTAL
        
        This command dumps permissions from Plone site PORTAL to a file called
        local_roles.txt located in OUTDIR. If directory does not exist, it is
        automatically created.
        
        NOTE: specifying the output directory is optional, it defaults to directory
        "output" in the same directory from where the script is run.
        Plone site name is optional as well and defaults to "Plone".
        
        To generate HTML tree view run the following::
        
            $ bin/instance html_export --output-dir OUTDIR
        
        The OUTDIR, if specified, must refer to the same output directory that was
        used to dump role info in previous step. Directory's default name is again
        "output".
        
        Open the created HTML `<OUTDIR>/local_roles_tree.html` directly from the
        filesystem with your browser.
        
        NOTE: in case of large files this might take some time, because synatree.js
        script  must walk through the DOM and do its work. It might appear in the
        meantime that the browser is unresponsive - it's just doing its work.
