        Eve is an out-of-the-box, highly customizable and fully featured RESTful Web
        API framework that you can use to effortlessly build and deploy your own APIs
        
        Eve is Simple
        -------------
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from eve import Eve
        
            app = Eve()
            app.run()
        
        The API is now live, ready to be consumed:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ curl -i http://example.com/people/
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        
        All you need to bring your API online is a database, a configuration file
        (defaults to ``settings.py``) and a launch script.  Overall, you will find that
        configuring and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.
