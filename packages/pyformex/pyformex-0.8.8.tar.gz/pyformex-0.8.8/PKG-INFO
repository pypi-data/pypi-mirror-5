Description: 
            pyFormex can be used to generate, transform and manipulate large
            geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical operations.
            Unlike traditional CAD systems, pyFormex provides a powerful (Python based)
            scripting language as the basic user input, making it very well suited 
            for automated and repeated (parametric) design procedures. 
            It provides a wide range of operations on meshes, like STL type triangulated
            surfaces and FEA or CFD grids. Nurbs curves and surfaces are under
            development.
            pyFormex is often used to create models from medical scan images, or as a
            pre- and post-processor for Finite Element analysis programs. But it could
            just as well be used to just create some nice 3D renderings.
