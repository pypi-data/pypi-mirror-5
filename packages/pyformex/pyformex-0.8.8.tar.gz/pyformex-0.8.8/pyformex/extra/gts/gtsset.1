.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
gtsset [OPTION] OPERATION surface1.gts surface2.gts
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Compute boolean operations between surfaces. OPERATION is one of:
union, inter, diff, all.
.sp
surface1.gts and surface2.gts are files with closed surface representations
in GTS format.
.sp
The default operation is to write to stdout a new closed surface in GTS format.
For the \(aqall\(aq operation however, four GTS surface files are written:
s1out2.gts, s1in2.gts, s2out1.gts, s2in1.gts.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i,  \-\-inter
Instead of outputting a surface, output an OOGL (Geomview)
representation of the curve intersection of the surfaces.
.TP
.B \-s,  \-\-self
Check that the surfaces are not self\-intersecting.
If one of them is, the set of self\-intersecting faces
is written (as a GtsSurface) on standard output.
.TP
.B \-v,  \-\-verbose
Print statistics about the surface.
.TP
.B \-h,  \-\-help
Display this help and exit.
