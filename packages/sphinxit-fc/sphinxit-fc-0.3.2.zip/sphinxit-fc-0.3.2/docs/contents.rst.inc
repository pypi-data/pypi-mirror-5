Less theory, more practice. Usually we have no time and desire to read lengthy docs,
so this part is more or less like "How To". If you prefer more detailed and strict docs, 
Sphinxit has documented :ref:`API`. Also, you always can explore tests and sources, 
it`s quite useful for understanding internal project architecture.
