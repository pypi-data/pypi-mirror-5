Description: plone.recipe.alltests
        =====================
        
        This recipe creates a testrunner script which is suitable for running all
        tests in a buildout environment at once.
        
        At least in Zope2 there are frequently test isolation problems caused by too
        much global state being used. Instead of fighting against these test isolation
        problems, this recipe provides a convenient way to run all tests on a package
        by package basis, provides an overall summary and exits with a combined status
        code for all tests runs. The latter makes it possible to use this in a
        buildbot environment.
        
        
        Options
        -------
        
        The options you can set in the recipes section in your `buildout.cfg`.
        
        eggs
          A list of packages that should be tested. Defaults to the eggs of the
          [test] part, if available. Tests of these packages and all their
          dependencies will be run.
        
        test-script
          The file system location of a `zc.recipe.testrunner` test runner, which
          needs to be configured correctly to run all tests for all specified eggs.
          Defaults to ``bin/test``.
        
        exclude
          A list of eggs which should be excluded from the test runs. The values are
          interpreted as Python regular expressions.
        
        groups
          A buildout section containing a mapping of group names to package names.
        
        package-map
          An buildout section containing a mapping of distribution names to package
          names.
        
        
        Scripts
        -------
        
        This recipe create one script named after the recipe section.
        
        All options are optional, so a minimal part looks like this::
        
          [test-all]
          recipe = plone.recipe.alltests
        
        This creates a ``bin/test-all`` script that runs bin/test for all eggs (and
        their dependencies) specified in the [test] part.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.3 - 2013-10-08
        ----------------
        
        - Make it possible to run a single test group by specifying the --group= option.
          This can aid with debugging test isolation problems.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.2 - 2009-11-06
        ----------------
        
        - Refactor test summary somewhat to make it easier to parse.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Exclude ``distribute`` by default from the test runs. Clarify that we always
          run tests for all dependencies of the packages listed in the eggs option.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.1 - 2009-08-19
        ----------------
        
        - Added bin/test as default for test-script option.  And [test]'s eggs (if the
          part is available) are used if the eggs option isn't specified explicitly.
          [reinout]
        
        1.0 - 2009-08-02
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for grouping multiple packages into one test group, avoiding
          some of the shared test setup cost.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added total test time to the output.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Automatically extend the test path with the package location.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Allow the use of regular expressions in the exclude list.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Initial implementation.
