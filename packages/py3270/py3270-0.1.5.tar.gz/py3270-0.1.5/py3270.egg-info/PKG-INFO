Description: Intro
        -----
        
        py3270 is a Python interface to x3270, an IBM 3270 terminal emulator.  It
        provides an API to a x3270 or s3270 subprocess.
        
        Example
        --------
        
        A brief example of usage::
        
            from py3270 import EmulatorBase
        
            class Emulator(EmulatorBase):
                x3270_executable = '/fake/x3270'
                s3270_executable = '/fake/s3270'
        
            # use x3270 so you can see what is going on
            em = Emulator(visible=True)
        
            # or not (uses s3270)
            em = Emulator()
        
            em.connect('3270host.example.com')
            em.fill_field(17, 23, 'mylogin', 8)
            em.fill_field(18, 23, 'mypass', 8)
            em.send_enter()
        
            # if your host unlocks the keyboard before truly being ready you can use:
            em.wait_for_field()
        
            # maybe look for a status message
            if not em.string_found(1, 2, 'login succesful'):
                abort()
        
            # do something useful
        
            # disconnect from host and kill subprocess
            em.terminate()
        
        Documentation
        --------------
        
        None.  Read the code, its pretty self-explanatory  :)

        Current Status
        ---------------
        
        The interface seems sound, but the Emulator class has only basic functionality.
        There are more x3270 commands that the Emulator could have methods for. That
        being said, I believe most x3270 functionality can be supported at a lower-level
        by the use of Emulator.exec_command().
        
        The `py3270 tip <http://bitbucket.org/rsyring/py3270/get/tip.zip#egg=py3270-dev>`_
        is installable via `easy_install` with ``easy_install py3270==dev``.
