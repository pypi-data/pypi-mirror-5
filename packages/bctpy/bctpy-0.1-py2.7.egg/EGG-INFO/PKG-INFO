        ==PACKAGES USED==
        BCT python is light on packages. It requires numpy. Scipy is required for use
        with some functions for its linear algebra computations.
        
        ==ABOUT BCTPY AND OTHER AUTHORS==
        BCT is a matlab toolbox with many graph theoretical measures off of which bctpy
        is based.  I did not write BCT (apart from small bugfixes I have submitted).  
        With few exceptions, bctpy is a direct translation of matlab code to python.
        
        bctpy should be considered beta software, with BCT being the gold standard by 
        comparison. I did my best to test all functionality in bctpy, but much of it is
        arcane math that flies over the head of this humble programmer. There *are* 
        bugs lurking in bctpy, the question is not whether but how many. If you locate 
        bugs, please submit them to me at rlaplant@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu.
        
        Credit for writing BCT goes to the following list of authors, especially Olaf
        Sporns and Mika Rubinov.
