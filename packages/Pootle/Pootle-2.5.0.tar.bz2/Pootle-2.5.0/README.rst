Pootle
======

`Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`_ is an online translation and
localization tool.  It tries to lower the barrier of entry,  but also provides
tools to enable teams to work towards higher quality while welcoming newcomers.


Pootle is a Server
------------------

Pootle is written in Python using the Django framework and therefore can be
installed on any web server that supports serving WSGI applications.

A number of translation projects for a number of languages can be hosted on
Pootle.  It allows a team to manage their files, permissions, projects, and
also allows for translation on-line.  Files can be downloaded for offline
translation and later uploaded again.
