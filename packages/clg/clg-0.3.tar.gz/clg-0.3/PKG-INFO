Description: Command-line generator in python
        ================================
        
        This module is a wrapper to **argparse** module. Its goal is to generate a
        custom and advanced command-line from a formatted dictionary. The sequence of
        subparsers is not limited but it is not possible to have a (sub)parser that have
        both subparsers and options. The idea is really to not write dozens or hundreds
        of lines of code to generate the command-line but to outsource it to a file in a
        "classic" format (YAML, JSON, ...).
        
        Code is available on Github (http://github.com/fmenabe/python-clg).
        Documentation is available on readthedocs (https://clg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

        ~~~
          * Add an iterable and accessible namespace for arguments.
          * Change behaviour of *parse* method (now return a namespace with arguments).
          * Set default value for *list* type to empty list.
          * Change behaviour of the execution of an external module. It is no longer a

            In addition, keyword 'lib' as be replaced by 'path'.
          * Replace '__FILE__' in default value of an option by the directory of the
            program.
