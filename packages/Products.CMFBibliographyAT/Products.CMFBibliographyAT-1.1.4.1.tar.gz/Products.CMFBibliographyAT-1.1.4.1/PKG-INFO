Description: =================
        CMFBibliographyAT
        =================
        
        CMFBibliographyAT is the Archetypes based version of CMFBibliograhy.  It
        enables handling of references to (scientific) publications in Plone. It
        provides a 'Bibliography Folder' content type dedicated to holding reference
        objects of various kinds, like for 'articles', 'books', 'preprints',
        'techreports', contributions to collections, ...  The folder supports
        import/export of BibTeX formated files.
        
        In addition the package adds a 'bibliography' action to the portal tabs and it
        provides a BibliographyTool called 'portal_bibliography' through which you can
        manage the renderers and parsers for the import/export functionality.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * Add ``Products.CMFBibliographyAT`` to the ``eggs`` option of your
          buildout.cfg file and re-run buildout.
        
        * Either choose the ``CMFBibliographyAT`` extension profile while
          creating a new Plone site or install it through the add-on 
          control panel within the Plone UI.
        
        
        What it does
        ============
        
        CMFBibliography provides various new content types:
        
        * Bibliography Entries: Highly structured content objects to
          hold bibliographic data referencing a publication. The schema
          is derived from BibTeX (LaTeX's bibliography handling module).
        
        * Bibliography Folder: Enhanced 'Skinned Folder' with some
          import/import functionality (available through the 'import' tab).
        
        Allowed content types are restricted to reference types.
        
        Currently supported import formats are 'BibTeX', 'Endnote', 'RIS',  'Medline'
        and XML/MODS.  Check out the accompanying files in 'import_samples' to see this
        in action.
        
        Currently supported export formats: BibTeX (but see below), 'Endnote', 'RIS'
        and 'XML/MODS'.
        
        
        Under the folder's 'defaults' tab you can (i) specify default
        links for authors of references with the folder and (ii) define
        a ranking for the references within the folder. Through the
        ranking it is possible to control which references will be
        returned when "asking" the folder for its 'Top(n)' references
        (see the bibliography folder's source code for more).
        
        In addition CMFBibliographyAT adds two field indexes ('Authors'
        and 'publication_year') and three meta data fields ('Authors',
        'publication_year', and 'Source') to the portal catalog (if not
        present) to provide the 'bibliography' action which is added
        to the portal tabs (if you don't want this, go to
        'portal_bibliography > Actions' and tick off its visibility).
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        * Bibutils (optional) http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/software/bibutils
          to extend the range of supported import/output formats. Bibutils is
          mandatory for any kind of export/import. Minimum version is Bibutils 4.6.

          Plone 4 username or email is unicode?) but merging it with the old report 
          before storing it failed: old report is utf8 so convert unicode to utf8 if
