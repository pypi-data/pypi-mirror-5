Release History
---------------

0.1.4 (Not yet released)
++++++++++++++++++


0.1.3 (2013-11-16)
++++++++++++++++++

- Removed *.md from the MANIFEST file as it warns when installing that no files matching *.md are found.
- Fix allowing an IntervalSet to be initialised with a generator.

0.1.2 (2013-10-12)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed the rendering of the README on pypi (hopefully!) by converting it from a .md file to a .rst file.

0.1.1 (2013-10-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- Adding Manifest file to fix the pypi release. This was broken because the README.md was not being included in the source distribution but setup.py had a reference to this file and therefore failed to run.

0.1.0 (2013-07-03)
++++++++++++++++++

- Initial release
