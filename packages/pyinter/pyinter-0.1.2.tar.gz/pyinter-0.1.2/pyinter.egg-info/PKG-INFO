        Pyinter is a small and simple library written in Python for performing interval and discontinous range arithmetic.
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> pyinter.openclosed(1.1, 12)
            (1.1, 12]
            >>> discontinous_range = pyinter.IntervalSet([pyinter.closedopen(5, 10), pyinter.closed(22, 23)])
            >>> discontinous_range
            IntervalSet([5, 10), [22, 23])
            >>> 7 in discontinous_range
            True
            >>> 10 in discontinous_range
            False  # This isn't in the range as it is an open interval which doesn't include its end points
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  interval objects which can be
        
           -  unioned
           -  intersected
           -  easily constructed using helper functions: *open, closed, openclosed and closedopen*
        
        -  interval sets which can be
        
           -  unioned
           -  intersected
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install Pyinter, simply:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install pyinter
        
        Or, if you absolutely must:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ easy_install pyinter
        
        But I'm told you really shouldn't do that.

        Release History
        ---------------
        
        0.1.2 (2013-10-12)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed the rendering of the README on pypi (hopefully!) by converting it from a .md file to a .rst file.
        
        0.1.1 (2013-10-09)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Adding Manifest file to fix the pypi release. This was broken because the README.md was not being included in the source distribution but setup.py had a reference to this file and therefore failed to run.
        
        0.1.0 (2013-07-03)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Initial release
