Introduction to reststore 
*************************

Why reststore?

 reststore is used by my friends and I as a simple way to share and store
 samples of malware.  Large volumes of files are what we're in it for.  The
 advantage we get from using reststore is in its ability to return slices 
 of hashes based on chronological ordering of data insert.  It implements
 a simple yet powerful fetch, cache, and store pattern that makes handling
 large volumes of data a trivial problem. 
  
What is reststore:

 * A convenient way to store large quantities of data.
 * Ability to access data locally or access it via a server hosting the
   reststore webapp. 
 * Chain together multiple webapp servers until they reach the single
   authoritative reststore webapp.

What's in reststore: 

 * A simple interface called Files which gives full control over and access
   to reststore's capabilities. 
 * Flexible configuration to support more complex deployments of reststore.
 * A set of command line operations to get, put, and list data.
 * A RESTful webapi so data can be accessed in a client agnostic manner.

Install
=======

Simply run the following::

    > python setup.py install
    
or `PyPi`_:: 

    > pip install reststore
    

Getting started
===============


Coding with reststore
---------------------
Files and FilesClient are the two main classes used to access data from a store.

A local session:: 

 $ ipython

 In [1]: import reststore

 In [2]: files = reststore.Files()

 In [3]: files.
 files.get        files.hash_len   files.put        
 files.hash_func  files.index      files.select     

 In [3]: files.put("test data")
 Out[3]: 'eb733a00c0c9d336e65691a37ab54293'

 In [4]: files.put("test with some more data")
 Out[4]: 'a99fb3880c8ac126b3cf6163aa965305'

 In [5]: files.put("test with some more data... and more")
 Out[5]: 'e93a9d514c57f96d158864754f1ca330'

 In [6]: files['e93a9d514c57f96d158864754f1ca330']
 Out[6]: u'/tmp/files/00195/00065/3'

 In [7]: files.select(2,-1)
 Out[7]: ['e93a9d514c57f96d158864754f1ca330']

 In [8]: files.select(1,-1)
 Out[8]: [a99fb3880c8ac126b3cf6163aa965305', e93a9d514c57f96d158864754f1ca330']

 In [9]: for hexdigest in files:
    ...:     print hexdigest 
    ...:     
 eb733a00c0c9d336e65691a37ab54293
 a99fb3880c8ac126b3cf6163aa965305
 e93a9d514c57f96d158864754f1ca330

The exact same code above will work using the FilesClient class which will
seamlessly interface with a reststore webapp server.


Configuring reststore
---------------------

reststore has a very simple configuration system.  Configuration is applied
in the following order:

 * defaults from reststore.config
 * /etc/reststore.yaml
 * ~/reststore.yaml
 * environ <- each config value is written RESTSTORE_[INTERFACE]_[NAME]=Value

Example of the default config::

 $ cat ~/.reststore.yaml 
 
 client: {uri: 'http://127.0.0.1:8586/'}
 files: {assert_data_ok: false, hash_function: md5, name: files, root: /tmp, tune_size: 100000000}
 webapp: {debug: false, host: 127.0.0.1, port: 8586, proxy_requests: false, quiet: false,
 server: wsgiref}
     

Command line interface
----------------------

Exploring the command line interface should expose the core features of
reststore::

 $ reststorei -h

 NAME reststore - control over the reststore 

 SYNOPSIS
     reststore [COMMAND]

 Commands:
     
     get [FILE-OPTIONS] [HEXDIGEST] > stdout
         Attempt to retrieve a file and write it out to stdout.  A check is
         made in the local reststore first, if the file is in available, an
         attempt to read the file from the web reststore is made. 
     
         arguments 
             Use HEXDIGEST to define hash to read from the reststore.

     put [FILE-OPTIONS] FILEPATH(s) 
         Put a file into the reststore.   
     
         arguments 
             Path(s) of files to be loaded into the reststore.

     unzip [OPTIONS FILE-OPTIONS] ZIPFILE 
         Extra files from a zipfile straight into the reststore. 
     
         arguments 
             A path to the zip file to extract into the reststore.

         options
             --password=
                 Define a password for unzipping the zip file.
             --flush=1000 
                 Number of files to read into memory before flushing through
                 to the reststore.

     list [OPTIONS FILE-OPTIONS] 
         list out hexdigests found in the reststore.   
     
         options
             --select=[A:B]
                 List all of the hashes between A:B.  Hashes are stored
                 chronologically.  0 is the first file inserted, -1 is the last
                 file inserted.  i.e. select the last 1000 hexdigests -1001:-1

     len [FILE-OPTIONS]
         print out the number of files stored in the reststore.   
     
     web [OPTIONS FILE-OPTIONS] [[HOST:][PORT]] 
         Run the RESTful web app.
         
         arguments 
             HOST:PORT defaults to 127.0.0.1:8586

         options
             --server=wsgiref
                 Choose the server adapter to use.
             --debug=False 
                 Run in debug mode.
             --quiet=False
                 Run in quite mode.
             --proxy_requests=False
                 If True, this web app will proxy requests through to 
                 the authoritative server defined by the client uri.

 File options:
     --name=files
         Set the default reststore name (i.e. domain or realm) 
     --hash_function=md5
         Set the hash function to be used
     --tune_size=100000000
         Set the approximate size the reststore may grow up to.
     --root=/tmp
         Set the root for the reststore.
     --assert_data_ok=False
         Do extra checks when reading and writing data.
     --weboff
         This flag forces access to a local repository only.
     --uri=http://170.0.229.223:8586/
         The uri to the upstream reststore web server.
