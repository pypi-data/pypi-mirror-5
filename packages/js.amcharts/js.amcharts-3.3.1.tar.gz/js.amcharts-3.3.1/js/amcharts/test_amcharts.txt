How to use?
===========

You can import ``amcharts`` or ``amstock`` from ``js.amcharts`` and ``need`` it
where you want these resources to be included on a page:

* ``amcharts`` will provide only the `Chart`_ library...
* while ``amstock`` will provide both the `Chart`_ and `Stock`_ libraries.

  >>> from js.amcharts import amstock, amcharts
  >>> amcharts.need()
  >>> amstock.need()

amCharts needs a few images sometimes, and you need to pass the path to the
images in the Javascript code as follow::

    chart = new AmCharts.AmSerialChart();
    chart.pathToImages = "/lib/samples/javascript/images/";

Since this path depends on your server configuration and Fanstatic
configuration, you can use the convient ``find_images_url`` from this library:

  >>> from js.amcharts import find_images_url
  >>> find_images_url() # doctest: +SKIP
  "/some/path/images/"
