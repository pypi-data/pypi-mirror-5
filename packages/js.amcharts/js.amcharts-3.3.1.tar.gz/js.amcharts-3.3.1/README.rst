js.amcharts
***********

Introduction
============

This library packages `amCharts`_ for `fanstatic`_. It provides both the
`Chart`_ and `Stock`_ Javascript chart libraries.

.. _fanstatic: http://fanstatic.org
.. _amCharts: http://www.amcharts.com
.. _Stock: http://www.amcharts.com/stock-chart/
.. _Chart: http://www.amcharts.com/javascript-charts/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``, and
making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources`` directory
in ``js.amcharts``) are published to some URL.

You can find the repository for this package at
