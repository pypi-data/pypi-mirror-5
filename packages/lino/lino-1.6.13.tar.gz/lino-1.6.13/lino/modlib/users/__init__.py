"""

Lino's :mod:`lino.modlib.users` is an alternative to Django's 
:mod:`django.contrib.auth` module.

This module is much more simple and does not require
:mod:`django.contrib.sessions` to be installed.
See :doc:`/tickets/31` for discussion.

To use it, you must define the following things in your :class:`lino.Lino`::

    user_model = 'users.User'
    
    def get_installed_apps(self):
        for a in super(Lino,self).get_installed_apps():
            yield a
        yield 'lino.modlib.system'
        yield 'lino.modlib.users'
        # continue with your own modules
