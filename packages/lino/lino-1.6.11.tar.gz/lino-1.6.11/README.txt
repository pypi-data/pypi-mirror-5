A framework for writing desktop-like web applications using Django and ExtJS

Description
-----------

Lino is a high-level framework for writing desktop-like customized 
database applications based on `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
and `Sencha ExtJS <http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`_.

Examples of Lino applications are
`Lino-Welfare <http://welfare.lino-framework.org>`__,
`Lino-Patrols <http://patrols.lino-framework.org>`__
or
`Lino-Faggio <http://faggio.lino-framework.org>`__.

A Lino application is technically just a Django project, 
but the application developer does not need to write any 
URLconf, HTML nor CSS (`more <http://lino-framework.org/about>`_)

Lino is based on three other projects by the same author:
`atelier <http://atelier.lino-framework.org>`__,
`djangosite <http://site.lino-framework.org>`__
and
`north <http://north.lino-framework.org>`__.
