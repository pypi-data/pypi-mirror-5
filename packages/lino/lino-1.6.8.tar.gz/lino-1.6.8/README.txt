A framework for writing desktop-like web applications using Django and ExtJS

Description
-----------

Lino is a high-level framework for writing desktop-like customized 
database applications based on `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
and `Sencha ExtJS <http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`_.
A Lino application is technically just a Django project, 
but the application developer does not need to write any 
URLconf, HTML nor CSS (`more <http://lino-framework.org/about>`_)

The following real-world applications use the Lino framework:

- `Lino-Welfare <http://welfare.lino-framework.org>`__

Lino uses the following projects by the same author:

- `djangosite <http://site.lino-framework.org>`__
  provides startup signals and the `settings.SITE` object.
  
- `north <http://north.lino-framework.org>`__
  provides python dumps, multilingual database content 
  and data migration.
