        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `SpiffForm`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of SpiffForm's
        structure.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`SpiffForm`: https://github.com/knipknap/SpiffForm
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory) are published to some URL.
        
        Git subtree of SpiffForm
        ------------------------
        
        We use git `subtree`_ to get SpiffForm.
        
        .. _`subtree`: https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-subtree-merge
        
        How::
            
            $ git remote add -f spiffform https://github.com/lugensa/SpiffForm.git
            $ git merge -s ours --no-commit spiffform/master
            $ git read-tree --prefix=js/spiffform/resources/ -u spiffform/master
            $ git commit -m "Subtree merged in js/spiffform/resources/"
        
        Pull changes::
        
            $ git pull -s subtree #this only works if we use not nested prefix name 
            $ git pull --squash -s subtree https://github.com/lugensa/SpiffForm.git
        master
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import spiffform from ``js.spiffform`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.spiffform import spiffform
          >>> spiffform.need()
