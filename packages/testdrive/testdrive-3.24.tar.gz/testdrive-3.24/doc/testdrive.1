.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtestdrive\fP is a utility that allows you to easily download the latest Ubuntu development release or Cloud image, and run it in a virtual machine.

The global configuration file, \fI/etc/testdriverc\fP, is sourced first, followed by the user's local configuration file, \fI~/.testdriverc\fP, and xdg configuration \fI~/.config/testdrive/testdriverc\fP.

Users wanting to change the behavior default configuration can make a copy of the global configuration \fI/etc/testdriverc\fP, and either store it as \fI~/.testdriverc\fP, or as another file and pass that filename on the command line.

Downloaded ISO files and disk images are stored in \fI~/.cache/testdrive\fP, and may optionally be cleaned out, periodically.
