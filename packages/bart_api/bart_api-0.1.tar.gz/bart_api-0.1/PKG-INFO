        Description
        -------------
        A simple python package that interacts with the [Bay Area Rapid Transit API](http://api.bart.gov/docs/overview/index.aspx).
        
        Usage
        -------------
        
        install bart_api with:
        
            git clone github.com/projectdelphai/bart/api
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        To create a new object:
        
            from bart_api import BartApi
        
            bart = BartApi()
        
        If you have your own API key (which you can get at the BART API website), you can use that instead of the default free one with:
        
            bart = BartApi("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
        
        To get the number of live trains:
        
            live_trains = bart.number_of_trains()
        
        To get the status of all elevators:
        
            elevators_status = bart.elevator_status()
        
        To run the tests to make sure everything is running well, run this command in the root directory:
        
            python -m unittest discover
