Description: batou
        =====
        
        batou is a multi-(component|host|environment|...) deployment utility.
        
        Deployments are described in a model using "components" and can be deployed
        locally and remotely. Models are written as Python code.
        
        See the `batou documentation <http://batou.readthedocs.org>`_ for details
        on how to use it.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.6 (2013-05-18)
        ==================
        
        - Add component that clones from a Mercurial repository.
        - Write supervisord.pid into /run/local instead of ${workdir}/var to ensure
          correct startup after machine crashes.
        - Add `ignore_returncode` parameter to Component.cmd() to suppress exceptions
          on unsuccessful command execution.
        
        
        0.2.5 (2013-04-23)
        ==================
        
        - Fix interaction between supervisor programs and disabled supervisors: don't
          try to start those programs.
        
        
        0.2.4 (2013-04-22)
        ==================
        
        - Force reread/update on supervisor after config changes.
        
        
        0.2.3 (2013-04-22)
        ==================
        
        - supervisor: wait up to 60 seconds instead of 30 until supervisor responds to
          a PID after triggering shutdown. Fix bug trying to detect shutdown:
          RuntimeError would cause residual data in output variables.
        
        - supervisor: after reloading, wait as long as the highest startup delay was
          configured on a program to avoid subsequent accidental restarts.
        
        - supervisor: remove 'restart' flag: always restart if we have a relevant
          change.
        
        - supervisor: fix bug in reload logic: path to supervisord.conf was wrong
        
        0.2.2 (2013-04-19)
        ==================
        
        - Allow specifying 'configure_args' on cmmi.Build or 'args' on cmmi.Configure.
        
        - Fix supervisor's path lookup for event listeners to support the automatically
          installed superlance plugins better. This may change again in the future
          depending on other event listener needs.
        
        
        0.2.1 (2013-04-18)
        ==================
        
        - Fix supervisor refactoring: templates contained static paths from my
          development machine. Event listeners were not formatting the event list
          correctly.
        
        - Let RunningSupervisor wait (infinitely) long when reloading if the
          supervisorctl command returns 'SHUTDOWN_STATE'. This supports large
          installations with many services more gracefully but might get stuck.
        
        - Fix supervisor's Nagios check: I removed the bin/py custom interpreter and
          didn't notice it was used by the check. Put it back.
        
        0.2 (2013-04-18)
        ================
        
        - Lots of stuff that went on unreleased for way too long. Producing a release
          to allow people to stop running from trunk.
        
        - Buildout component: Allow custom buildout.cfg names and pass the name to
          bootstrap.
        
        - Improve SSH connection error logging: more readable now and hosts are
          identifiable. (#12093)
        
        - Do not automatically add missing SSH host keys any longer. (#11606)
        
        - Use python version specific virtualenv, if availble. This helps with ancient
          Python 2.4 components. For specific virtualenv versions no explicit python
          executable is passed.
        
        - Internalize download hash handling using hashlib. Allow selection of hash
          function. (Thanks to Christine Koppelt.)
        
        - Introduce new component modelling approach.
        
        - Start writing documentation.
        
        - Improve error message when download fails due to checksum mismatch.
