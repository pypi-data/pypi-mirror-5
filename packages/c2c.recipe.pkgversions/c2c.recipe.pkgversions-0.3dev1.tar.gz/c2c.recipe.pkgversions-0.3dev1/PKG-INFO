Description: c2c.recipe.pkgversions
        ======================
        
        Recipe used to test the Debian package requirement.
        
        This recipe requires that dpkg is in the path.
        
        Example of use::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = ...
                pkgversions
                ...
        
            [pkgversions]
            recipe = c2c.recipe.pkgversions
            mapserver-bin = 6.0.3
            libproj0 = 4.8
        
        This example tests that we have at least the version 6.0.3 of mapserver,
        and the version 4.8 of proj.
        
        No version mean no-test.
        
        To just test that the package is installed use the version
        ``dev`` (minimal version) or ``installed`` (alias).
        
        It the version is set to ``not-installed`` mean that
        we want that the package isn't installed.
