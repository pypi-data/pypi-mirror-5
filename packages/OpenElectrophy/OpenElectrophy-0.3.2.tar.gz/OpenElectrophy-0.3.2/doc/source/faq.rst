FAQ
==========================================



 * **Is OpenElectrophy really free ?**

  Yes

 * **So why is this software so good ?**
  
  Developers are really good at programming.
  
  
 * **Are developers nice guys ?**
 
  Yes! And there are good looking too. You should buy them a glass of wine.


 * **Do I absolutely need to learn SQL ?**
  
  No. You can just click and play. Learning SQL will benefit at later times to synthetize very large datasets.
  
 
 * **Do I absolutely need to learn python ?**
 
  No. But often reseachers want to explore something new. If you want this, you need to code your own analyses.
  
 * **Do I need to re-code my old script in matlab, R, C++ ?**
 
  Of course not! Python provides tools to reuse codes in foreign languages:
   
   * Matlab code can be reached through : http://mlabwrap.sourceforge.net/
   
   * C code : http://www.cython.org/ or http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/
   
   * R cran : http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html
 
  So you can mix in the same analysis Python, SQL, Matlab and C!
 

 * **My boss has used Matlab for 15 years, made very very very specific developments and she/he do not want to change.
   What can I say to convice him ?**
 
  * Do not say anything.
  * Use it.
  * Be efficient.
  * Do the port of 15 years of development in 2 months.
  * And show her/him the result.
