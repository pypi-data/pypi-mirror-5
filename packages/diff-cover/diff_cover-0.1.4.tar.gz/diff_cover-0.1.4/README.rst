diff-cover
==========

Automatically find diff lines that need test coverage.  
This is used as a code quality metric during code reviews.

Overview
--------

``diff-cover`` compares an XML coverage report with a ``git diff``
and reports which lines in the diff are covered.

XML coverage reports can be generated with tools such as 
`coverage.py`__

Getting Started
---------------

To install, navigate to the ``diff-cover`` directory and run:

    python setup.py install

You can then use the command:

    diff-cover COVERAGE_XML [--html-report REPORT.html]

This will compare the current git branch to ``BRANCH``, identify lines
that are not covered (based on ``COVERAGE_XML``), and (optionally) generate an HTML report.

``diff-cover`` ignores files not referenced in ``COVERAGE_XML``, since these files
are not tested.  This means that documentation and configuration changes
will be ignored.

If ``--html-report`` is not specified, ``diff-cover`` prints a text report
to stdout.

``diff-cover`` uses the following to find diff lines:

- Commits in the current branch that are not also in master (``git diff origin/master...HEAD``).
- Staged changes in the current branch (``git diff --cached``).
- Unstaged changes in the current branch (``git diff``).



Troubleshooting
----------------------

**Issue**: ``diff-cover`` always reports: "No lines with coverage information in this diff."

**Solution**: ``diff-cover`` matches source files in the coverage XML report with
source files in the ``git diff``.  For this reason, it's important
that the relative paths to the files match.  If you are using `coverage.py`__
to generate the coverage XML report, then make sure you run
``diff-cover`` from the same working directory.
