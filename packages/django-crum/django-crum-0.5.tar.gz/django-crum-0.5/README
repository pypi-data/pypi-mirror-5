Django-CRUM
===========

Django-CRUM (Current Request User Middleware) captures the current request and
user in thread local storage.

It enables apps to check permissions, capture audit trails or otherwise access
the current request and user without requiring the request object to be passed
directly. It also offers a context manager to allow for temporarily
impersonating another user.

It is tested against Python 2.6 and 2.7 using Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.
