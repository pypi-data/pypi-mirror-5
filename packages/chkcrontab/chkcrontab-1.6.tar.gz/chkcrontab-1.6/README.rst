Crontab linter
==============
chkcrontab is a script to check crontab files like those in
``/etc/cron.d`` and ``/etc/crontab``.  It tries to catch glaring
errors and warn on suspect lines in a crontab file.  Some valid
lines will generate warnings.  Certain silly yet valid crontab lines
will generate errors as well.

Run this by doing::

    chkcrontab crontab_file

Errors will cause a non-zero exit code.  Warnings alone will not.

To see sample output for a bad crontab, run the following::

  ./chkcrontab ./tests/test_crontab

See the ``./tests/test_crontab.disable`` crontab for how to disable
warnings and errors.

Output Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The output of ``chkcrontab`` is described on the `CheckCrontab`_
wiki page. A link to it appears in the output if there were any
warnings or errors. It also suggests ways to fix the reported
issues.

Contributions
=============
Contributions are welcome! Please add unit tests for new features
or bug fixes.  To run all the unit tests run ``./setup test``.
If you have `tox`_ installed, just run ``tox``.

You can review `coverage`_ of added tests by running
``coverage run setup.py test`` and then running
``coverage report -m``.

Note that tests are run on `Travis`_ for all supported python
versions whenever the tree on github is pushed to.

The packaged version is available via ``pip`` or ``easy_install``
as ``chkcrontab``. The project page is on `pypi`_:

The source code is available in the following locations:

* Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/lyda/chkcrontab/
* code.google: https://code.google.com/p/chkcrontab/
* Github: https://github.com/lyda/chkcrontab
* Gitorious: https://gitorious.org/uu/chkcrontab
* Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/p/chkcrontab

Pull requests on any of those platforms or emailed patches are fine.
Opening issues on github is easiest, but I'll check any of them.

TODO
====
* Look for duplicate entries. Puppet sometimes loads up crontabs
  with dups.
* Check for backticks. (why?)
* Make sure MAILTO and PATH are set (perhaps others?).
* Add tests for command line.
* Enable it to parse user crontabs: https://code.google.com/p/chkcrontab/issues/detail?id=2
* Make "acceptable filenames" a configurable thing: https://github.com/lyda/chkcrontab/issues/4
