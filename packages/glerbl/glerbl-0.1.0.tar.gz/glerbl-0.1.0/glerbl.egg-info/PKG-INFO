Description: Glerbl is a tool to help manage git hooks and promote consistent
        coding standards among contributors to a repository.
        
        Let's say you maintain a github repository for which you want to ensure
        the following coding standards:
        
        * No trailing spaces.
        * No non-ascii file names.
        * All python code must conform to pep8.
        
        You can hope that contributors will remember to run the necessary
        checks before they send in pull requests or push code to the
        repository.
        
        Or you can use glerbl to formalize your requirements and provide all
        collaborators with the means to detect problems and fix these problems
        before they commit.
