Description: Activity Stream and Subscription Enhanced Engine
        ================================================
        
        MAX is a system for collecting and viewing activity logs generated by users and
        applications as well or by the interaction between users and applications.
        
        MAX records activity in two ways: active and passive. The active mode is when
        users and application contact with the MAX API for register the activity they
        generate. The passive mode is when MAX try to find the activity that is
        generated by some external systems through predefined rules, for example, the
        activity generated by a Twitter account and hashtag associated.
