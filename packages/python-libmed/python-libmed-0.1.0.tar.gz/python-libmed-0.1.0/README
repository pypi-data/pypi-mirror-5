python-libmed is a package that provides a wrapper to the libmed C library to
manipulate MED files; the wrapping is done using Cython. MED files are used to
store and exchange meshed data or computation results. The underlying file
format is HDF5.

python-libmed's user interface (API) consists of pure Python modules that
allow manipulation of fundamental components of a MED file (the file itself,
meshes, fields, numerical parameters, etc.). The main entry point is the
MEDFile class which provides an interface to a MED file and to its components.
