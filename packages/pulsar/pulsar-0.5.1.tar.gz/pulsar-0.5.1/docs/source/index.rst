Application Framework
=========================

Pulsar application framework is built on top of :mod:`pulsar` concurrent
framework. It is designed to facilitate the development of both server-side
applications such as web servers, task queues as well as asynchronous
clients.
To write a new server-side application, you subclass :class:`pulsar.apps.Application` or
any of the shipped applications listed below, and implement some of
the callbacks available.

Currently, pulsar is shipped with the following applications which can be
found in the :mod:`pulsar.apps` module:
