``hg-commit-sanity`` is a Mercurial extension that allows to easily create precommit hooks to do sanity checks on commits.

Kudos to `Matthew Schinckel <http://schinckel.net/2013/04/07/hg-commit---prevent-stupidity>`_

Installation
------------

.. sourcecode ::

    pip install hg-commit-sanity

Configuration
-------------

An example of your .hgrc:

.. code-block:: cfg

    [extensions]
    hg_commit_sanity =

    [hg_commit_sanity]
    .py =
        ^[^#]*import pdb; pdb.set_trace\(\)
    .js =
        ^[^(//)]*console\.[a-zA-Z]+\(.*\)

This will Abort the commit in case it will find import pdb; pdb.set_trace() in *.py files and console. in *.js files
