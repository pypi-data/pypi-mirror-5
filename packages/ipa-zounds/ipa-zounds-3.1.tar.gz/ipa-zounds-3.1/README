        INSTALLATION

To install IPA Zounds, use the following command from the directory in
which this README is located:

  python setup.py install

This will install the ipazounds package in the standard location for
Python packages on your system, and add the three scripts to your
path. People using Linux will probably need to run the above command
as root (sudo python setup.py install).

This installation uses Python's distutils; if you get an error such as
"error: invalid Python installation: unable to open
/usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)" (on a
GNU/Linux system), then you need to install the Python package for
your distribution which contains distutils (for Debian GNU/Linux, this
is python-dev).


        RUNNING IPA ZOUNDS

Most users will want to run ipa-zounds.py.

See the HTML user manual for details of the various ways to run the
scripts and use the ipazounds package.
