- python binary on shebang lines of the python scripts that are built by the recipe
  should be the same as the one ``buildout`` script is using.

- detection of running postgres is not working properly

- some buildout options around bin-dir are unreliable and seems mixed up in
  some places. Should be thoroughly reviewed and corrected and documented.

- write tests.
