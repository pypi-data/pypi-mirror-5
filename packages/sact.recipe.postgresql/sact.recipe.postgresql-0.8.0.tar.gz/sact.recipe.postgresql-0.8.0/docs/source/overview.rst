Overview
========

This package is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe which allows to install a custom version
of the `PostgreSQL`_ database server, locally to the package you are working on.

It can install the database server from:

    * source: this is handy if you want to quickly test your application with a
      new release of `PostgreSQL`_ or with a new development snapshot;

    * pre-compiled binary: if you already have a compiled version of PostgreSQL,
      you can also reuse it to speed up the buildout process.


The recipe will give you several tools in the ``bin/`` directory to control the
server. Thus, you will be able to start and stop it, launch a command line
utility on the server, and so on.

.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org

Supported options
=================

The recipe supports the following options:

admin
    Aministrator accounts to create. Defaults to ``postgres``.

superusers
    Super-users accounts to create. Defaults to ``root``.

users
    User accounts to create.

location
   Destination of Postgresql. Defaults to the buildout section name.

url
   Download URL for the target source version of Postgresql (required if
   url-bin is empty).

url-bin
   Download URL for the target binary version of Postgresql. This option is
   always used if it is set.

conf_dir
    Folder of configuration files (the folder must exist). Defaults to ${location}.

postgresql.conf
    Custom Postgresql configuration. Two options are required:
    data_directory unix_socket_directories (unix_socket_directory for older
    versions of PostgreSQL).


Binary url
==========

The recipe can detect automatically your platform within *(arch)s* in the url.
The syntax must follow the Python convention (read the sys.platform documentation).
The goal is to use a CI tool on various platforms without create an buildout
file to each one.

The binary mode is useful when you use a CI tool: you can test quickly the new
code.

Examples
========

Simple example:

[pg92]
recipe = sact.recipe.postgresql
url = http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v9.2.2/postgresql-9.2.2.tar.bz2
conf-dir = /etc/postgresql/9.2
postgresql.conf =
    data_directory = '/srv/postgresql/9.2/db'
    unix_socket_directories = '/var/run'

More options:

[pg92]
recipe = sact.recipe.postgresql
url = http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v9.2.2/postgresql-9.2.2.tar.bz2
configure-options =
    --without-readline
    --with-python
make-options =
    -j10
conf-dir = /etc/postgresql/9.2
postgresql.conf =
    data_directory = '/srv/postgresql/9.2/db'
    unix_socket_directories = '/var/run'
    listen_addresses = ''
    fsync = off
    synchronous_commit = off
    full_page_writes = off
    wal_buffers = 1024kB
    wal_writer_delay = 5000ms
