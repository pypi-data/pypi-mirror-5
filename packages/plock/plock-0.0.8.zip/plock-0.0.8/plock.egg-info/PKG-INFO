        =====
        
        Plock is a Plone Installer for the Pip-loving Crowd
        
        .. Note:: Installing Plone with Plock requires an internet connection. If you want to install Plone offline, try `Plone's Unified Installer <http://plone.org/download>`_.
        
        .. Warning:: Installing Plone with Plock is inherently insecure because it relies on a remote hosted configuration file(s) that in theory could be compromised during a MITM-attack.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. Note:: Plock supports the latest release (and only the latest release) of Plone, currently Plone 4.3.
        
        Installing and running Plone with Plock looks like this::
        
            $ pip install plock
            $ bin/install-plone
            $ bin/plone fg
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Plone uses `Buildout <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ to manage its installation and configuration. Plock creates a ``buildout.cfg`` file for you that (initially) looks like this::
        
            [buildout]
            extends = https://raw.github.com/pythonpackages/buildout-plone/master/latest
        
        Add-ons 
        ~~~~~~~
        
        .. Warning:: Plock lists packages on PyPI with a description, keyword, or summary containing "plone". Results may include packages that are not installable in the current release of Plone. This issue may be addressed in a future release of plock.
        
        To list available add-ons::
        
            $ bin/install-plone --list-addons
        
        To install add-ons, add the desired Python package name(s) to the command line e.g.::
        
            $ bin/install-plone --install-addons Products.PloneFormGen
        
        Restart Plone and install the add-on(s) in Plone via Site Setup -> Add-ons. After you install add-ons with Plock your ``buildout.cfg`` file will look like this::
        
            [buildout]
            extends = https://raw.github.com/pythonpackages/buildout-plone/master/latest
        
            [plone]
            eggs = 
                ${base:packages}
                ${version:packages}
                Products.PloneFormGen
        
        Why
        ---
        
        Why bother building Plock on top of Buildout? Plock is a work around for ``pip install Plone`` which works but requires a lengthy requirements.txt, and lacks additional features provided by Buildout that are needed to use ``pip install Plone`` effectively.
        
        Pip
        ~~~
        
        Why bother supporting pip? To advance the state of Plone such that Buildout can be used, but not required.
        
        Buildout
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Why make Buildout optional? To market Plone to Python Programmers who are generally more familiar with pip than Buildout.
