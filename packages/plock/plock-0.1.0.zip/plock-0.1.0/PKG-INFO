        Plock is a Plone Installer for the Pip-loving Crowd
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. Note:: Installing Plone with Plock requires an internet connection. If you want to install off-line, try the `Unified Installer <http://plone.org/download>`_.
        
        .. Note:: Plock supports the latest release (and only the latest release) of Plone, currently Plone 4.3.
        
        Installing and running Plone with Plock looks like this::
        
            $ virtualenv-2.7 .
            $ source bin/activate
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install plock
            $ plock
        
        ::
        
            $ plone fg
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Plone uses `Buildout <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ to manage its installation and configuration. Plock creates a ``buildout.cfg`` file for you that initially looks like this::
        
            [buildout]
            extends = release.cfg
        
        ``release.cfg`` extends several other configuration files in the current working directory.
        
        Add-ons 
        ~~~~~~~
        
        .. Warning:: Plock lists packages on PyPI with a description, keyword, or summary containing "plone". Results may include packages that are not installable in the current release of Plone. This issue may be addressed in a future release of plock.
        
        To list available add-ons::
        
            $ plock --list-addons
        
        To install add-ons, add the desired Python package name(s) to the command line e.g.::
        
            $ plock --add-on Products.PloneFormGen
        
        Restart Plone and install the add-on(s) in Plone via Site Setup -> Add-ons. After you install add-ons with Plock your ``buildout.cfg`` file will look like this::
        
            [buildout]
            extends = release.cfg
        
            [plone]
            eggs = 
                ${base:packages}
                ${version:packages}
                Products.PloneFormGen
        
        Why
        ---
        
        Why bother building Plock on top of Buildout? Plock is a work around for ``pip install Plone`` which works but requires a lengthy requirements.txt, and lacks additional features provided by Buildout that are needed to use ``pip install Plone`` effectively.
        
        Pip
        ~~~
        
        Why bother supporting pip? To advance the state of Plone such that Buildout can be used, but not required.
        
        Buildout
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Why make Buildout optional? To market Plone to Python Programmers who are generally more familiar with pip than Buildout.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1.0 (2013-07-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Make "secure"
            - All Buildout configuration files (for Plone, Zope2, the ZTK, etc.) are included in plock; this eliminates the possibility of a MITM-attack via remote extends (now you just need to trust PyPI and dist.plone.org.)
        
        - Changed features:
            - Renamed script: ``install-plone`` to ``plock``.
            - Renamed arg: ``--install-addons`` to ``---add-on`` (to improve argparse-provided usage statement).
        
        0.0.9 (2013-07-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fixes:
            - Don't print "Wrote buildout.cfg" if buildout.cfg exists.
        
        0.0.8 (2013-07-25)
        ------------------
        
        - New features:
            - Added --write-config to write buildout.cfg and exit.
        
        0.0.7 (2013-07-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fixes:
            - Restore -U
        
        0.0.6 (2013-07-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fixes:
            - Make sure addons list is sorted.
        
        0.0.5 (2013-07-24)
        ------------------
        
        - New features:
            - Added --raw, for use with --list-addons e.g. bin/install-plone --list--addons --raw
            - Added --preserve for use with --install-addons e.g. bin/install-plone --install-addons Products.PloneFormGen --preserve
        - Bug fixes:
            - bin/install-plone with --install-addons PACKAGE(S) can now be run the first time to install both Plone and add-ons.
            - bin/install-plone --install-addons PACKAGE(S) saves a copy of buildout.cfg and reverts changes if a Buildout run fails.
