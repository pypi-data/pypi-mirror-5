        Conntrackt
        ==========
        
        Conntrackt (Connection Tracker) is a simple Django application for tracking
        connection requirements between different entities in a network.
        
        The application was written with intention to be used by system adminstrators
        and integrators that deploy servers on customer premises, and need to keep tight
        track of possible communication links between different entities in the
        project.
        
        In addition to keeping track of connections, the application has the ability to
        generate simple *iptables* rules based on the connections specified. The
        generated rules can be easily applied using the *iptables-restore* utility.
        
        
        Features
