Description: ########################
        Welcome to SeriesMarker!
        ########################
        
        .. note::
        	This package should currently be considered as a pre-release.
        
        In its current state, the application itself should have reached gold state for
        the 'official' release (which is supposed to be version 0.1). However, there
        still needs to be done some work at the documentation and the setup-script.
        
        The same goes for this README and a description of the project on its site.
        Thus, the package version will probably be increased often, until everything
        is set for the official release of SeriesMarker. 
        
        In the meantime, if you are brave enough, try out this package and do not
        hesitate to give me your feedback or feel free to stop by later!
        
        .. warning::
        	Due to Google's recent decision to deprecate direct downloads from Google
        	Code, I need to reconsider my decision, which host to use for the sources.
        	As an interim solution, downloads related to SeriesMarker can be found at
        	one of my Dropbox folders. This also includes the **binary installer**,
        	regardless of what currently is stated in the documentation. I apologize
        	for the	inconvenience this may cause.

        Version 0.0.2
        =============
        
        * Users of Microsoft Windows can now utilize an all-in-one binary installer.
        * The `Documentation`_ is now online and should provide some initial help.
        * The setup script now uses distribute, which should make it easier to resolve
          the package dependencies.
