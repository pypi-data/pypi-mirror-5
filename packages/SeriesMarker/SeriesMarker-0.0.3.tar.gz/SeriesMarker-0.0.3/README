SeriesMarker is a tool that lets you keep track of watched episodes of your
favorite TV|nbsp|series. It is inspired by `Series Watcher`_, which has been 
discontinued by its original author, Corentin Chary (`iksaif`_). SeriesMarker
is a complete re-implementation in Python.

SeriesMarker is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.
