js.underscore
*************

Introduction
============

This library packages `underscore.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`underscore.js`: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.underscore``) are published to some URL.
