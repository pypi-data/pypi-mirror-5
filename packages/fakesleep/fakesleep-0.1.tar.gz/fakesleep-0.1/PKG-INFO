Description: fakesleep
        =========
        
        fakesleep is a simple module for tests that use `time.sleep()`. Sleeping in
        tests is generally considered bad (as it makes tests run slow). Using
        sleep with `time.time()` can lead to spurious failures, as clock
        precision / interpeter overhead can cause small differences in reported
        times.
        
        But sometimes, you need `sleep()`.
        
        fakesleep provides a fake implementation of `time.sleep()` that doesn't
        actually sleep. It also guarrantees "correct" results for calls to
        `time.time()` and other time functions. Note that `datetime` functions are
        **not** faked.
        
        To install, simply call `fakesleep.monkey_patch()`. To restore the real versions, call `fakesleep.monkey_restore()`.
