        Rationale
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Configuration values are usually found on well defined locations. On Linux
        systems this is usually ``/etc`` or the home folder. The code for finding these
        config files is always the same. But finding config files can be more
        interesting than that:
        
        * If config files contain passwords, the application should issue appropriate
          warnings if it encounters an insecure file and refuse to load it.
        
        * The expected structure in the config file can be versioned (think: schema).
          If an application is upgraded and expects new values to exist in an old
          version file, it should notify the user.
        
        * It should be possible to override the configuration on a per installed
          instance, even per-execution.
        
        ``config_resolver`` tackles all these challenges in a simple-to-use drop-in
        module. The module uses no additional external modules (no additional
        dependencies, pure Python).
        
        Additionally, the existing "default values" mechanisms in Python is broken, in
        that cannot have two different default values for the same variable name in two
        different sections.
