Description: # Docker Selenium Grid
        
        CLI program for building and managing a Selenium Grid with Docker containers. Each browser node runs a single instance of the browser. I find this 
        helpful when running Selenium tests in parallel.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Docker
        * Python 2.7
        * setuptools
        
        ## Installation
        
        This installation will build the following Docker containers: Selenium Hub, PhantomJS, and Firefox.
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/brady-vitrano/dsgrid.git
        cd dsgrid
        python setup.py install
        dsgrid install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once installed you can start and manage a Selenium Grid. Example:
        
        ```
        # Start the Hub
        dsgrid start
        # Add Nodes 
        dsgrid nodes add firefox
        dsgrid nodes add phantomjs
        # Restart Nodes by Browser
        dsgrid nodes restart firefox
        # Restart All Nodes
        dsgrid nodes restart
        # Check Status
        dsgrid status
        # Shutdown
        dsgrid shutdown
        ```
        
        View the Grid console on: http://localhost:49044/grid/console
        
        ## Hacking
        
        Feel free to hack the Dockerfiles and scripts under `files/`. Pull requests are welcomed.
        
        ## Author Note
        
        I put this together over a weekend. I am not very strong in Python but wanted to build a CLI app which can be easily
        installed on Docker hosts.
        
        The tests are incomplete. What you see are my TDD leftovers.
        
        ## Missing/TODO
        
        * Fix tests
        * Add logging and debugging options
        * Add ChromeDriver
        * Add CLI usage help with tabcomplete
        * Add documentation on configuring Dockerfiles for custom Selenium settings ie proxy, timeouts, etc
