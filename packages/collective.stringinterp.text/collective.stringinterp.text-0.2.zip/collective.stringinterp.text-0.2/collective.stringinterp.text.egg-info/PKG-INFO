        Getting text
        ------------
        
        "Main text field" is an abstract entity.
        This product try to guess text using adapters, so you can override or provide more specific
        ones (see the code some example).
        
        Generally, those kind of text extraction is supported:
        
        * ATContentTypes based content types with a *text* field
          (Event, News Item, Document, Topic)
        * Comment from plone.app.discussion
        * Dexterity content types with a *text* field
        
        Plus, a general adapter that simply try to read if a "text" attribute is provided.
