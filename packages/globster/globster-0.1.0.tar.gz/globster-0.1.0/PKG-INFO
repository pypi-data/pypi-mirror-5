        Tools for converting globs to regular expressions.
        
        This work is derived from `Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ (bzrlib) and `Mikko Ohtamaa <https://github.com/miohtama/vvv/tree/master/vvv/bzrlib>`_. I just created the Python package.

            if g.match("/path/to/dir/myscript.pyc"):
                print "it match"
