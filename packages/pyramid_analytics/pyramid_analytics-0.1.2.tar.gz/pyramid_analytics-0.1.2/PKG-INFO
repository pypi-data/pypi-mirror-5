        =================
        
        Segment.io initializer for the Pyramid Web Framework. 100% Test Covered.
        
        - The following configuration options are required in your config.ini::
        
            pyramid.includes =
                pyramid_analytics
        
            analytics.secret = mysekret
            analytics.flush_at = 20
            analytics.flush_after = 10
            analytics.async = True
            analytics.send = True
            analytics.max_queue_size = 100000
          
        - ``flush_after`` specifies after how much time (in seconds) of no flushing 
          that the server will flush. Used in conjunction with the flush_at size 
          policy.
        
        - To manage the ``log_level`` and ``log`` options specified by Segment.io's
          analytics-python, you should set the following configuration in your .ini
          file::
        
            [logger_analytics]
            level = WARN
            handlers = console  # The config needs to include this handler
            qualname = analytics
            propagate = 0  # This "disables" logging
            formatter = generic  # The config needs to include this formatter  
        
          Additionally, you'll want to register this logger:
        
        - Under the hood, analytics-python turns logging "off" by setting the logging
          level to ``CRITICAL``. Setting ``propagate = 0`` is perhaps a more elegant
          solution.
          
        - All other options are detailed at url: https://segment.io/libraries/python
        
        
        0.1.2 (2013-07-02)
        ------------
        
        - Relying on Pyramid's asbool helper for more robust boolean detection.
        
        
        0.1 (2013-07-01)
        ------------
        
        - Allow for the following segment.io configuration options: 
          ``secret``, 
          ``flush_at``, 
          ``flush_after``, 
          ``async``,
          ``send``, 
          ``max_queue_size``
        
        - Logging configuration is also supported
