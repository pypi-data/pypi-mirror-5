Description: 
        RedRover
        ========
        
        UNDER DEVELOPMENT - RedRover is not ready for production use and is
        made available for the curious only.
        
        RedRover is a testing utility suite for Django.  It wraps other powerful
        tools such as Nose and Selinium into an easy to use and read syntax.
        
        At its core, RedRover borrows from other python projects and provides
        an interface with custom syntax sugar inspired by the RSpec and Capybara
        projects that are used widely with Ruby on Rails.
