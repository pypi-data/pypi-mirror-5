Description: EasyBuild: building software with ease
        --------------------------------------
        
        The easybuild-easyblocks package provides a collection of easyblocks for
        EasyBuild (http://hpcugent.github.com/easybuild), a software build and
        installation framework written in Python that allows you to install
        software in a structured, repeatable and robust way.
        
        Easyblocks are Python modules that implement the install procedure for a
        (group of) software package(s). Together with the EasyBuild framework,
        they allow to easily build and install supported software packages.
        
        The code of the easybuild-easyblocks package is hosted on GitHub, along
        with an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests, see
        http://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyblocks.
        
        The EasyBuild documentation is available on the GitHub wiki of the
        easybuild meta-package, see
        http://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Home.
