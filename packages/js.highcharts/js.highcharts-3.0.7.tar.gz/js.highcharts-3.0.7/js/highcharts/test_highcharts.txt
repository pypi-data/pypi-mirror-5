How to use?
===========


You can import ``highcharts`` from ``js.highcharts`` and ``need`` it where you
want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.highcharts import highcharts
  >>> highcharts.need()

Or if you want to use the exporting module::

  >>> from js.highcharts import highcharts_exporting
  >>> highcharts_exporting.need()
