        =============
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `Highcharts`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.highcharts``) are published to some URL.
        
        **Highcharts is not free for commercial use!**
        Please make sure to read the `licensing information`_!

        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``highcharts`` from ``js.highcharts`` and ``need`` it where you
        want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.highcharts import highcharts
          >>> highcharts.need()
        
        Or if you want to use the exporting module::
        
          >>> from js.highcharts import highcharts_exporting
          >>> highcharts_exporting.need()
