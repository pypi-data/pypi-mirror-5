Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        **Formerly collective.recipe.bootstrap**
        
        ``buildout.bootstrap`` is a Buildout extension that adds a Buildout ``bootstrap.py`` file to your buildout.
        
        It satisfies the use case:
        
            "I want to keep my buildout's bootstrap.py file up to date without having to download it manually."
        
        It also makes it easy to add a ``bootstrap.py`` file to a buildout created via ``buildout init`` e.g.::
        
            $ buildout init
        
        After running this command, you have a ``buildout.cfg`` that looks like this::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
        
        And you can now add the extension like so::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.bootstrap
            parts =
        
        Run buildout again and afterward you should have a ``bootstrap.py`` file. Once you have a ``bootstrap.py`` file you can bootstrap the buildout via::
        
            $ python bootstrap.py 
        
        If you still don't understand, consider the following: with this extension you can avoid having to type::
        
            $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/buildout/buildout/2/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
        You typically use this extension when you have created a new buildout and want to:
        
        - Check it in to version control
        - Check it out somewhere else and bootstrap it with python only (i.e. no setuptools available)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add ``buildout.bootstrap`` to the ``extensions`` parameter in the buildout section of your ``buildout.cfg`` e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.bootstrap
            parts =
