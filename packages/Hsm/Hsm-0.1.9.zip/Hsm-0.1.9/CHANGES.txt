Hsm 0.1.8
----------------------
5 August 2013
Mayor changes:
 - totally removed logging from the runtime and replaced with an optional @trace_state(logger=None)
   which will trace the execution on _entry()/_exit()/send_xx()/on_xxx() and transition().
   Tracing is enabled hierarchically just mark for tracing a state using @trace_state(logger=None) and
   all it's children will inherit tracing.
 - removed run() from the runtime. The user must be in control of the main loop
 - added a timeout parameter to the update(timeout=None). if the user set's None the system will block until an
   event arrives
 What's next:
 - we still need to rump up documentation:
