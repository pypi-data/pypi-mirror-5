Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package adds a new view to Plone's Link content type. If the remote url of
        the link is a video supported by p4a.videoembed it will embed video.

        Why this package ?
        ==================
        
        I needed a way to display video links in a thumbnail gallery style view
        This provides a simple view for collections of video links. Currently thumbnails from Vimeo are 
        the only ones supported (more to come).
