        pytesla is a python binding to the `Tesla Model S REST API <http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/>` so that you can monitor your car or programmatically interact with it. It makes it easy to schedule charging times, trigger heating/cooling according to weather or just gather stats.
        
        It currently maps the REST API 1:1.
