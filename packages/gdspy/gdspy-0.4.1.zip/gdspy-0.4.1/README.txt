Version: 0.4.1
Author: Lucas Heitzmann Gabrielli


1. Installation

You will need to have the Python programming language installed in your
system (tested in version 2.7, but 2.6 should work as well):
  * http://www.python.org/

You will also need the modules numpy, and, optionally, Python Imaging
Library (needed only if you want to output the geometry to an image
file):
  * http://numpy.scipy.org/
  * http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm

To install gdspy execute the following command in the folder where you
uncompressed the gdspy distribution:

    python setup.py install

Windows users will need a development environment to compile the boolean
extension module (automatically performed by the install command above).
For 32-bit systems, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition has been
used successfully.


2. Usage

The file gdspy-sample.py is a sample script to show the features
provided by this module.  The complete module reference can be found in
the html folder or online at:
  * http://gdspy.sourceforge.net/

  * Removed the gds_view function, superseded by the LayoutViewer, along
  with all dependencies to matplotlib.
  * Fixed a bug in boolean which affected polygons with series of
  collinear vertices.
  * Added a function to slice polygons along straight lines parallel to
  an axis.

Version 0.2.4 (September 04, 2010)
  * Added shortcut to Extents in LayoutViewer: 'Home' or 'a' keys.
  * PolygonSet is the new base class for Round, which might bring some
  incompatibility issues with older scripts.
  * Round elements, PolyPath, L1Path, and Path arc, turn and parametric
  sections are now automatically fractured into pieces defined by a
  maximal number of points.
  * Default value for max_points in boolean changed to 199.
  * Removed the flag to disable the warning about polygons with more
  than 199 vertices.  The warning is shown only for Polygon and
  PolygonSet.
  * Fixed a bug impeding parallel parametric paths to change their
  distance to each other.

Version 0.2.3 (August 09, 2010)
  * Added the PolyPath class to easily create paths with sharp corners.

  clipping).
  * All classes were adapted to work with the boolean operations.
  * The attribute size in the initializer of class Text does not have a
  default value any longer.
  * The name of the argument format in the function gds_view was changed
  to fill (to avoid confusion with the built-in function format).

Version 0.1.6 (December 15,  2009)
  * Sample script now include comments and creates an easier to
  understand GDSII example.
  * Improved floating point to integer rounding, which fixes the unit
  errors at the last digit of the precision in the GDSII file.
