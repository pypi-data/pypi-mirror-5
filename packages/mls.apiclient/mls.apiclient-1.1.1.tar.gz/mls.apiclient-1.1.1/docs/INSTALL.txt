mls.apiclient Installation
==========================

When you're reading this you have probably already run ``easy_install mls.apiclient``. Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``mls.apiclient`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

     [buildout]
     ...
     eggs =
         ...
         mls.apiclient

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

     $ ./bin/buildout
