Description: # Curdling - A Concurrent package manager for Python
        
        [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/clarete/curdling.png)](http://travis-ci.org/clarete/curdling)
        
        # Installing
        
        ```python
        easy_install curdling
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```python
        pip curdling
        ```
        
        # In a nutshell
        
        What if you could speed up your python builds seamlessly ?
        Replace your `pip install` with `curd install` today and feel the difference:
        
        Installing flask with curdling
        ```bash
        ~ॐ time curd install flask
        Installing: [##########] 100% (6/6)
        
        real	0m2.412s
        user	0m1.478s
        sys	0m0.669s
        ```
        
        Installing with pip
        ```bash
        ~ॐ time pip install -q flask
        
        real	0m16.359s
        user	0m3.036s
        sys	0m1.005s
        ```
        
        ## Why is it faster to install with curdling ?
        
        Python has a new<sup>1</sup>
        [PEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Enhancement_Proposal#Development)
        that proposes a binary format for distribution of compiled python
        packages called ["wheel"](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/).
        
        Curdling is a concurrent python package installer that smartly
        parallelize package discovery, dependency resolution, download,
        compiling, caching and installing.
        
        It's like `easy_install` or `pip`, but a lot faster.
        
        <sup>1</sup>: The PEP is "relatively new" from September 2012
