    If you want to verify payments and maybe update user
    info on the backend side, write a client-side callback
    that sends the payment's signed request data (effectively
    keeping the old model of a blocking credits callback
    instead of using a real-time update handler).

    This view checks the payment using the Graph API and
    sends an OrderCreated event.  If a subscriber raises an
    exception, it is logged, OrderCreationError is sent (an
    exception in one of its subscribers will also be logged),
    and HTTPServerError is raised.

    If the signed request is invalid, or if the payment ID in
    the signed request does not match the current URI,
    HTTPBadRequest will be raised and no event will be sent.
    This indicates a configuration or application bug; the
    error will be logged to aid debugging and refunding.
