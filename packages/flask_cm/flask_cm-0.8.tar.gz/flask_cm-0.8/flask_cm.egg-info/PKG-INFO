        --------
        
        THis program contains a beta code that is used to create a meshup for
        various clouds. IN this first release we focus on the creation of a
        yaml file that contains the information for thes clouds and can be
        used to derive rc files.
        
        In future we will have a full GUI available via flask.

        First initial version of fab cm
        
        Significant bugs and omissions in profile and table remain
        
        
        PREVIOUS CHANGES 
        ================
        
        * introduced a "cloud:" attribute in yaml so its easier to manage and
        extract the clouds without checking the type
        
        * worked on a nasty bug in the refresh method of openstack, and it
        now refreshes even after you deleted all vms.
        
        * changed the logic for the credentials and in addition to the clod:
        we have also a credentials: under each cloud
        
        * added a new parameter to the get function in cm_config that if set
        to expand=True it will replace the $ vars with those defined in the
        os.environ, so this is cool as it allows us to use $ vars now also in
        the yaml file
        
        
        
        * experiments with date picker: http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/
