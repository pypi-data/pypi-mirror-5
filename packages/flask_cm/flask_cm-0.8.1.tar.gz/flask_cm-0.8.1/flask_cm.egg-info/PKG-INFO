        CHANGES
        =======
        
        
        a) introduced a "cloud:" attribute in yaml so its easier to manage and
        extract the clouds without checking the type
        
        b) worked on a nasty bug in the refresh method of openstack, and it
        now refreshes even after you deleted all vms.
        
        c) changed the logic for the credentials and in addition to the clod:
        we have also a credentials: under each cloud
        
        d) added a new parameter to the get function in cm_config that if set
        to expand=True it will replace the $ vars with those defined in the
        os.environ, so this is cool as it allows us to use $ vars now also in
        the yaml file
