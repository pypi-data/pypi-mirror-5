Description: Mercuro
        =======
        
        Mercuro is a non-concurrent, unintelligent, Python-based threaded syslog
        listener that forwards all its events to a [Riemann][1] server.
        
        All interaction with Riemann is handled via the [Bernhard][2] library.
        
        You probably shouldn't use Mercuro in production yet, at least until it
        provides concurrency, forking, and a config file.
        
        See test.py for example use.
