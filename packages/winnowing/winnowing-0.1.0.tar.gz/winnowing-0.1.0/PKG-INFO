Description: Winnowing
        =========
        
        A Python implementation of the Winnowing (local algorithms for document
        fingerprinting)
        
        Original Work
        =============
        
        The original research paper can be found at
        http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=872770.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            >>> winnow('A do run run run, a do run run')
            set([(5, 23942), (14, 2887), (2, 1966), (9, 23942), (20, 1966)])
        
            >>> winnow('run run')
            set([(0, 23942)]) # match found!
        
        Default Hash Function
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Quite honestly, I did not know what hash function to use. The paper did
        not talk about it. So I decided to use a part of SHA-1; more precisely,
        the last 16 bits of the digest.
        
        Custom Hash Function
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You may use your own hash function as demonstrated below.
        
        ::
        
            def hash_md5(text):
                import hashlib
        
                hs = hashlib.md5(text)
                hs = hs.hexdigest()
                hs = int(hs, 16)
        
                return hs
        
            # Override the hash function
            winnow.hash_function = hash_md5
        
            winnow('The cake was a lie')
