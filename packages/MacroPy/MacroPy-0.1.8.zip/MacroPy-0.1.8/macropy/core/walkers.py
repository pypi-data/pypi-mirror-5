    The `transform` function takes either:

    - the `tree` to be transformed, or
    - the `tree` to be transformed and a `ctx` variable

    The `transform` function can return:

    - a single `new_tree`, which is the new AST to replace the original
    - a tuple which contains:
        - a `new_tree` AST, as above
        - `set_ctx(new_ctx)`, which causes the recursion on all child nodes to receive
          the new_ctx
        - `collect(value)`, which adds `value` to the list of collected values
          returned by `recurse_real`
        - `stop`, which prevents recursion on the children of the current tree
