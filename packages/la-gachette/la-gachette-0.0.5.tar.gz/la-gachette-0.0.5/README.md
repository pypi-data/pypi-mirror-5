gachette
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ops-hero/gachette.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ops-hero/gachette)

Python module to setup working copy of specific branch for a project, launch build of packages via `trebuchet` and attach the packages to a specific stack, ready for deployment. This can be used from the CLI or programatically as a python library.
This will trigger the process on remote build machines, by using `fabric`.

Installation
============

This is actually in pypi, so you can do:

    $ pip install la-gachette

Or to install the latest version from github:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ops-hero/gachette.git
    $ cd gachette
    $ sudo pip install -e install
    $ gachette -l

The build machine needs to have installed `trebuchet`:

    $ ssh hero@192.168.1.5
    $ sudo pip install le-trebuchet

Concept
=======

`Stack` is an artefact that represents a list of packages in a specific version. It is versioned as well. It ensures
consistency of the version dependencies. Deployments are only based on `stack`; a specific stack is deployed, therefore
only the specified version of the packages are then installed.

For example:

Stack 123 contains the config package version v1.0.0 and application package v2.0.0. The next stack, named 124, will
contains the version v1.0.1 for the config and v2.1.0 for the application. Like this we never have to worry if the v1.0.0
of the configuration works with the new application.

`Domain` is a type of stack. It basically groups functionally similar stack and defines which projects the stack should cover.
They could share project.s

For example:

The domain `backend` contains the API web server, the queue consumers, the search system. While the domain `frontend` contains the
mobile website, the user facing website.



Usage (CLI)
===========
Gachette is wrapping around some Fabric scripts. To see the list of commands available, run this:

    $ gachette -l
    Available commands:

        add_to_stack  Add created package to stack and reference packages.
        build         Build the package for the working copy remotely via trebuchet.
        prepare       Prepare the working copy remotely for the project.
        show_config   Dummp settings.
        stack_create  Create a new stack. From old one if specified.
        version

First we create the stack in a certain location. Note that the stack can be anything (semantic version or tag/name):

    gachette -H hero@192.168.1.5 stack_create:main,foobar1,/var/gachette

From now on, you can add as many as packages as you want for this stack, even overwrite a version of a certain package
by a new one.
We clone the repository and checkout a specific branch:

    gachette -H hero@192.168.1.5 prepare:test_config_first_build,git@github.com:ops-config/test_config,master

Now we build the packages (note: the name `test_config_first_build` is use as a key). Location where the packages should end up is specify:

    gachette -H hero@192.168.1.5 build:test_config_first_build,/var/gachette/debs

Now adding a package to the stack. We need to specify the package information as they came from the last command:

    gachette -H hero@192.168.1.5 add_to_stack:main,dh-secret-sauce-live,1.0.0,dh-secret-sauce-live-1.0.0-all.deb,/var/gachette,foobar1


Configuration (CLI)
===================
To avoid repeating settings, you can use a yaml file by specifying it as an
option.

For example:

    $ cat examples/vagrant.yml
    user:   vagrant
    hosts:
        -   0.0.0.0
    $
    $ gachette -c examples/vagrant.yml -l
    ...

Which will allow you to remove the `-H vagrant@0.0.0.0` option when calling `gachette`.

You can use this also to setup the settings for Fabric, using the 1 level deep syntax (like for `key_filename` for example).


Quick usage (CLI)
=================
Once you have your configuration well setup (projects..., meta_path, debs_path), you can start using the `quick` command:

    $ gachette quick:0.0.1,test_application
    $ gachette quick:0.0.1,test_config,fix-option

This will do the following:
* check out the master (or any branch specified) for the project `test_app`; the url is taken from the configuration as `projects.test_app.url`.
* build the packages into `debs_path` folder (coming from the config).
* use the git commit hash as the version of the package (add the branch if specified).
* add the packages built to the stack (in the `meta_path` specified in the config).

Note that the stack need to be setup before hand via `stack_create`.


Usage (as a library)
====================
You can also use Gachette programmatically as a python library.

    # to checkout a specific branch and build package out of it:
    from gachette.api import WorkingCopy

    # to create a stack and add packages to it:
    from gachette.api import Stack

Look at the file `gachette/main.py` for usage examples.

Usage (CLI locally, for testing)
================================
Before installing the entry point, you can test the commands like this:

    $ workon gachette
    $ gachette/main.py -l

Common issue:
=============

* No local forward agent:
The symptoms, while running a remote command:

      File "/home/deploy/.virtualenvs/deploy/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paramiko/agent.py", line 126, in _communicate
        events = select([self._agent._conn, self.__inr], [], [], 0.5)
    TypeError: argument must be an int, or have a fileno() method.

This is due to the fact that there is no local SSH agent running. Just start a local one: `eval `ssh-agent && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

Todo
====
* Able to create nested settings from the .gachetterc file (for project configuration).
* handle version by using the git commit hash.
* error handling.
* link the package creation and the stack addition (other than webcallback).
* clean up test and documentation
