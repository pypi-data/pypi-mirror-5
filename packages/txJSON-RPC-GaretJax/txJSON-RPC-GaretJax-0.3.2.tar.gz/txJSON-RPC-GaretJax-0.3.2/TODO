Known Issues
------------

* txJSON-RPC doesn't yet support the proposed v2.0 JSON-RPC protocol.

* There's a typo in txjsonrpc.meta ("creatig").

* The docs are built with an extraneous "README" added to the text as a result
  of the README file getting renamed to README.rst.

* Need to add a git mirror on Google Code.

JSON-RPC All
------------

JSON-RPC over TCP
-----------------

* add version support in proxy constructor and callRemote method

* add unit tests for proxy's use of version in constructor as well as
  callRemote

* pull out anything that has to do with setting the payload (e.g.,
  method/params dict) and put it in jsonrpclib

* clean up error checking, now that errors are going in the payload under the
  "error" key.


JSON-RPC over HTTP (web)
------------------------

* add unit tests for proxy's use of version in constructor as well as
  callRemote


jsonrpclib
----------

* return results in simpljson dicts with possible keeys of "result" or "error"

* use simplesjon's hook for creating appropriate JS objects from hints in the
  results
