        ============
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        txJSON-RPC currently has the following dependencies:
        
        * Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com/
        
        
        
        
        
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        If you want to develop for txJSON-RPC or use the latest code we're working on,
        you can install from the sources. You'll need bzr installed, and then just do
        the following::
        
            $ bzr branch lp:txjsonrpc
            $ cd txjsonrpc
            $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Easy Install
        ------------
        
        You can use the setuptools easy_install script to get txSpore on your system::
        
            $ sudo easy_install txJSON-RPC
        
        
        Manual Download
        ---------------
        
        You can manually download the source tarball from the Python Package Index by
        visiting the following URL:
        
            http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txJSON-RPC/
        
        You'll need to untar and gunzip the source, cd into the source directory, and
        then you can do the usual::
        
            $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Checking the Source
        -------------------
        
        Once installed, you can test the source code by executing this from the
        top-level source directory::
        
            $ trial txjsonrpc
        
        That will run the test suite and report on the success and failure of any unit
        tests.

        Usage

        Examples
        --------
        
        In the top-level source directory for txJSON-RPC, there is an examples
        directory.  This contains the following:
        
        * Client and server examples for twisted.web-based JSON-RPC.
        
        * Client and server examples for Netstring TCP JSON-RPC as well as code shoing
          how to use subhandlers for the TCP code, since this differs from the
          XML-RPC/JSON-RPC HTTP-based subhandlers.
        
        Examining each of the Python files in the example directories is the best way
        to get a sense of how to use txJSON-RPC.

        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        * txJSON-RPC doesn't yet support the proposed v2.0 JSON-RPC protocol.
        
        * There's a typo in txjsonrpc.meta ("creatig").
        
        * The docs are built with an extraneous "README" added to the text as a result
          of the README file getting renamed to README.rst.
        
        * Need to add a git mirror on Google Code.
        
        JSON-RPC All
        ------------
        
        JSON-RPC over TCP
        -----------------
        
        * add version support in proxy constructor and callRemote method
        
        * add unit tests for proxy's use of version in constructor as well as
          callRemote
        
        * pull out anything that has to do with setting the payload (e.g.,
          method/params dict) and put it in jsonrpclib
        
        * clean up error checking, now that errors are going in the payload under the
          "error" key.
        
        
        JSON-RPC over HTTP (web)
        ------------------------
        
        * add unit tests for proxy's use of version in constructor as well as
          callRemote
        
        
        jsonrpclib
        ----------
        
        * return results in simpljson dicts with possible keeys of "result" or "error"
        
        * use simplesjon's hook for creating appropriate JS objects from hints in the
          results
