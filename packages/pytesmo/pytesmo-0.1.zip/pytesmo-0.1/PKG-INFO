Description: ===========
        pytesmo - python Toolbox for the Evaluation of Soil Moisture Observations
        ===========
        
        pytesmo is a package which aims to provide easy reading functions for soil moisture data, as well as 
        functions for comparing these datasets against each other.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * easily read data from the `Supported Datasets`_
        * anomaly calculation based on climatology or using a moving window see :mod:`pytesmo.anomaly`
        * easy temporal matching of time series see :mod:`pytesmo.temporal_matching`
        * multiple methods for scaling between different observation domains (CDF matching, linear regreesion, min-max matching) see :mod:`pytesmo.scaling`
        * calculate standard metrics like correlation coefficients, RMSD, bias, 
          as well as more complex ones like triple collocation or MSE as a decomposition of the RMSD see :mod:`pytesmo.metrics`
        
        
        Supported Datasets
        ==================
        
        Soil moisture is observed using different methods and instruments, in this version the following datasets are supported.
        
        Remotely sensed products
        ------------------------
        
        Right now only soil moisture observations made with the ASCAT sensor on board the METOP satellites are
        supported but we are working on support for more products.
        
        ASCAT
        ~~~~~
        
        * ASCAT SSM(Surface Soil Moisture)
        * ASCAT SWI(Soil Water Index)
        
        which can both be downloaded for free after registration at http://rs.geo.tuwien.ac.at/products/
