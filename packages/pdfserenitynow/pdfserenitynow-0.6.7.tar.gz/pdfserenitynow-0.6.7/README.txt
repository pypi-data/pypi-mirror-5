PDF Serenity Now
==========================

PDF Serenity Now was born from our increasing contact with annoying PDFs. The
biggest culprits are multi-layered PDFs and PDFs with large pictures or 
graphics embedded in them which take forever to print, if you can get them to 
print at all. We created the original script to convert these PDFs to a more 
printer-friendly format (for the KIP series of plotters), namely flattened 
TIF Group 4.

At this time, it converts a single-page or multi-page PDF to a folder of TIFs. 
It handles large, crappy, multi-layer PDFs if you have enough RAM. `Poppler`_ 
and `Imagemagick`_ do all of the hard work.

In the future it will be smarter about converting, and offer more target
formats (JPG, PDF). The ultimate goal is a service where users can 
upload/submit a crappy PDF and get a nice set of TIFs or JPGs or a fixed PDF 
returned to them. It will have a control panel where you can monitor and 
manipulate conversions in progress or in a queue.
