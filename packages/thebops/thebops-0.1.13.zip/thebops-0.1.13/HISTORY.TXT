thebops 0.1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- thebops.optparse: based on optparse 1.5.3 by Greg Ward/Python 2.7.3,
  with some minor improvements.
  Since optparse is now "deprecated" and won't get developed further, but since
  Python 2.4 some changes have been made which demand error processing, in the
  medium term all improvements of thebops.enhopa are planned to be confered
  upon thebops.optparse (or thebops.opo) in the medium term.
- Adjustments for Python 2.4 compatibility
