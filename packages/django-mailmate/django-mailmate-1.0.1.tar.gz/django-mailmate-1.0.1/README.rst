Mailmate is a Django app comprised of tools to make dealing with emails easier.
Its main feature is a simple, class-based way to define email messages using
Django templates. Here's a quick sales pitch:

.. code-block:: python

    from mailmate import TemplatedEmailMessage

    class MyEmail(TemplatedEmailMessage):
        to = ['some-user@some-email.com']
        from_email = 'no-reply@some-email.com'
        subject = 'Hello, {{ name }}!'
        template = 'emails/template.txt'

    MyEmail(extra_context={'name': 'Jerry'}).send()


Installation
------------

``pip install django-mailmate``


TemplatedEmailMessage
---------------------

Extend ``TemplatedEmailMessage``, and set class attributes. You can override
any of those attributes by passing keyword arguments to the constructor.

.. code-block:: python

    from mailmate import TemplatedEmailMessage

    class MyEmail(TemplatedEmailMessage):
        to = ['some-user@some-email.com']
        from_email = 'no-reply@some-email.com'
        subject = 'Hello!'
        template = 'emails/template.txt'

    MyEmail(to=['somebodyelse@somewhereelse.com']).send()

You can use a template to define your email body (like in the above example), or
define it as a string:

.. code-block:: python

    from mailmate import TemplatedEmailMessage

    class MyEmail(TemplatedEmailMessage):
        to = ['some-user@some-email.com']
        subject = "The subject is parsed as a {{ what }}"
        body = "The body's also parsed as a {{ what }}."

    MyEmail(extra_context={'what': 'Django template!'}).send()

``TemplatedEmailMessage`` also makes it simple to create HTML emails. Simply add
an ``html_template_name`` attribute to your class (or pass it to the
constructor):

.. code-block:: python

    from mailmate import TemplatedEmailMessage

    class MyEmail(TemplatedEmailMessage):
        to = ['some-user@some-email.com']
        subject = "The subject is parsed as a {{ what }}"
        body = "The body's also parsed as a {{ what }}."
        html_template_name = 'emails/my_email.html'

The ``TemplatedEmailMessage`` class extends
``django.core.mail.EmailMultiAlternatives``, so you don't have to do anything
special to use it with your favorite backend.


CleanEmailBackend
-----------------

Mailmate also includes a special backend to help you debug your emails. It's
like Django's ``django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend``, but in
addition to the \*.log file, it will also save files containing the message body
for each version of the message. For example, if you send an email that has both
a plaintext and HTML version, it will save a \*.log file (with the entire
message), a \*.txt file (with the plaintext body) and a \*.html file (with the
body of the HTML alternative).

To use it, set your ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` and ``EMAIL_FILE_PATH`` settings in
settings.py:

.. code-block:: python

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'mailmate.backends.CleanEmailBackend'
    EMAIL_FILE_PATH = '/path/to/messages/'
