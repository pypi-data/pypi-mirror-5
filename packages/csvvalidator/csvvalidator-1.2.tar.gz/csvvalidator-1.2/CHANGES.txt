v1.1, 2011-07-27
================

* The convention for record check functions has changed in this
  release. Record check functions should now raise a RecordError if
  there is a validation problem in the record. RecordError is a new
  class in the csvvalidator module in this release. This change makes
  it easier to distinguish between exceptions reporting validation
  problems (i.e., RecordError), and unexpected exceptions raised
  during record checks (i.e., all other exception classes, including
  ValueError). See also https://github.com/alimanfoo/csvvalidator/issues/3

* This release supports a new convention for defining record check
  functions. In addition to the existing style, where record check
  functions are defined separately and added via the
  CSVValidator.add_record_check method, you can now also sub-class
  CSVValidator, and any method whose name starts with 'check' will be
  invoked as a record check function. This is similar to the style for
  'assert' methods. See also https://github.com/alimanfoo/csvvalidator/issues/4
