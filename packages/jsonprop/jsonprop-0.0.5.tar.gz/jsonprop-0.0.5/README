# About

Fine-grained control of JSON serialization using decorators.

# Why

Because sometimes you just need to serialize a few properties/exclude
null values/rename fields and want to do it declaratively.

# Usage

Imports

    from jsonprop import JsonObject, json_property

Inherit from JsonObject

    class MyJsonObjectClass(JsonObject):
        def __init__(self):
            self._test_prop = None

Decorate getter method with @json_property

    ...
        @json_property('json_test_prop', False)
        def get_test_prop(self):
            return self._test_prop 

use json() method inherited from JsonObject to serialize

        json = myclass.json()

Alternatively, use the json_field to concisely specify a set of serializable fields
on an object that may be assigned to as descriptors.

    class MyObj(JsonObject):
        field_one = json_field('fieldOne')
        field_two = json_field('fieldTwo')

Which may be serialized in the same manner as above.

JsonObject supports the use of keyword arguments at object initialization time. The
example class above may be conveniently instantiated as follows:

    myobj = MyObj(field_one = 'one', field_two = 'two')


# API

The general form of the decorator is:

    @json_property(name, include_null)

where name is the desired JSON field name for the python property and 
include_null is a boolean that indicates whether or not null values will 
be included in the serialization. By default this value is True and null values
will be serialized. If this is set to False, the field will be omitted entirely
in the serialized JSON output in the event that the value of the field is
None.

The decorator may be applied without arguments, in which case the field 
will not be renamed and nulls will be serialized. Note that the property
decorator must be called as a constructor, i.e. using empty parens `()'

    @json_property()


# Hacking

Serializing properties as collections, maybe extend this to (gasp) xml. 
Take a look at serialization properties in c# for more.
