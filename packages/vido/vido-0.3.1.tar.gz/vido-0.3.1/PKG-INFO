Description: 
            vido is a sudo-like command wrapper.  Commands run inside a new
            kernel, with passthrough access to the filesystem, whitelisted
            devices, and (if enabled) the network.
        
            The main uses are:
        
            * Experimentation.  Make small changes to the kernel and test them
              immediately.
            * Privilege elevation.  Commands run as root even if you don't have
              root privileges in the first place.
            * Regression testing.  Run the same command against multiple kernels.
            * Kernel debugging.  The --gdb flag will run the virtual kernel
              inside a debugger.
        
            See `github.com/g2p/vido <https://github.com/g2p/vido#readme>`_
            for installation and usage instructions.
