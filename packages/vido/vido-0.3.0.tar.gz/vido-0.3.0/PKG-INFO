Description: 
            vido is a sudo-like command wrapper that runs commands
            inside a lightweight virtual machine.
        
            The main uses are:
        
            * privilege elevation. Commands run as root even if you don't
              have root privileges in the first place.
            * quick testing. Make small changes to the kernel and test them immediately.
            * regression testing. Run the same command against multiple kernels.
            * kernel debugging. There is a --gdb flag that will run the virtual
              kernel inside a debugger. If you have an application that triggers
              kernel bugs, you can wrap it in vido --gdb, usually without changes.

            for installation and usage instructions.
