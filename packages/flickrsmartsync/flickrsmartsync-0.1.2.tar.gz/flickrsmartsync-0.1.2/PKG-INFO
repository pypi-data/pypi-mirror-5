        Overview
        ======================================================================
        flickrsmartsync is a tool you can use to easily sync up or down your
        photos in a drive/folder to flickr since now it has a free 1TB storage
        you can probably sync all your photo collection.
        
        It has the following features:
        
        upload
          by default without any command it will upload all photos wherever
          you run it from. It will be grouped into sets.
        
        download
          when you specify a download . means it will download all and recreate
          the same folder structure you uploaded it from, specifying a path
          will download only the folder/path.
