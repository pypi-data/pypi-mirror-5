Introduction
============

This module is the integration in plone of the jasmid javascript library.

It is not intended to be used as this : the raw sound is realy horrible !
Try : @@example-jasmid

This package is the first step to listen midi files without any external plugin.

It is intended to be used with the package collective.js.midijs which is an integration
of the midi libraries provided by MIDIjs : http://mudcu.be/midi-js/

This last Plone module is currently in development (on github : https://github.com/erichardy/collective.js.midijs)
and will be available on pypi soon.
