        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Galleria Slideshow`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware
        of different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Galleria Slideshow`: http://galleria.io
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.galleria``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import Galleria from ``js.galleria`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.galleria import galleria
          >>> galleria.need()
        
        You can use the classic theme, which is free to use::
        
          >>> from js.galleria import classic
          >>> classic.need()
