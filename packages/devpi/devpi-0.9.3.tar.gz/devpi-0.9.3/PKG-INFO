Description: devpi: managing and serving Python release processes
        ===================================================================
        
        ``devpi`` is a meta package installing two other packages:
        
        - `devpi-server <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi-server>`_: 
          for serving a pypi.python.org consistent
          caching index as well as local github-style overlay indexes.
        
        - `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi-client>`_: 
          command line tool with sub commands for
          creating users, using indexes, uploading to and installing
          from indexes, as well as a "test" command for invoking tox.
        
        For getting started see http://doc.devpi.net/

        0.9.3.dev
        ----------------------------
        
        server:
        
        - fixed issue9: caching of packages where upstream provides no
          last-modified header now works.
        
        - fixed issue8: only http/https archives are allowed and other
          schemes (such as ftp) are silently skipped
        
        - added support for REST DELETE methods of projects and versions on an index
        
        - added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
          (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)
        
        client:
        
        - new "devpi list" command to show projects of the in-use index or all
          release files of a project with "devpi list PROJECTNAME".
        
        - new "devpi remove" command to remove releases from the current index,
          including any contained release files
        
        - added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
          (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)
        
        
        0.9.2 (compared to 0.9.1)
        ----------------------------
        
        server:
        
        - fix /USER/INDEXNAME root views to contain only latest in-stage packages
        
        - make +api calls return bases so that "devpi use" can show them
        
        client:
        
        - introduce "devpi upload --fromdir" for uploading archives in bulk
          mode, thanks to Anthon van der Neut for helping with this!  (resolved issue5)
        
        - improve automatic server handling via "devpi use"
        
        - for "devpi server" you now need to specify "--log" to see log lines
        
        - make "devpi use" also show base indexes by default
        
        - fix issue4: auto-server data stored in non-dot dir
        
        
        0.9.1 (compared to 0.9.0)
        ----------------------------
        
        server:
        
        - return 404 for submits to root/pypi
        
        - properly sorted release file links on stage indexes
        
        - "push" method on indexes for transfering release files to another
          pypi index
        
        - properly handle urls from indexes with ~ and other special chars
        
        - fix root/pypi and root/dev page serving in various cases
        
        client:
        
        - refined "python setup.py" calls from ``devpi upload`` with proper
          ``__file__`` attributes.  Thanks Andi Albrecht.
        
        - implemented new "devpi push" command for pushing out releases
        
        - improved error handling for devpi upload
        
        - fix logoff if not logged in
        
        - don't use --force-reinstall when using pip
