**GetPaid for Plone**

GetPaid provides you basic commerce functionality (donations, shopping
cart, checkout) and order management out of the box while providing a
flexible framework for creating custom ecommerce applications. There are also a number of add-ons for GetPaid that can extend its functionality and are optional (discounts, UPS shipping, warehouse/inventory management, various payment processors etc).
