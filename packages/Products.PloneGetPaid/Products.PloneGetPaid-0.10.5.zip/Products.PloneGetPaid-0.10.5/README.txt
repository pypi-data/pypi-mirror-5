Introduction
============

PloneGetPaid is designed to make it easy to accept payments on your site. The
framework provides a simple way to get started with that, and a rich structure
for extending usage for specific needs.

GetPaid has been used in production since December 2007. Since then several
improvements have occurred to keep the product improving and evolving. You can
find a list of 15+ `Sites Using GetPaid`_, for examples of how it is used. For
more about the project, including features, updates, and ways to contribute,
please see our public web site, `www.plonegetpaid.com`_.

Installation
============

You can get the GetPaid product in two ways:

* Adding GetPaid to Existing Site - Read the latest `installation
  instructions`_.
* Testing/Developing: There is also a `development buildout`_ for GetPaid. This
  makes it easy for developers of GetPaid itself to get set up with everything
  needed for the product with just a few commands.
