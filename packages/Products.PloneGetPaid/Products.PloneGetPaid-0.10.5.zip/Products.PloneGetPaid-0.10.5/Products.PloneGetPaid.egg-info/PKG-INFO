Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        PloneGetPaid is designed to make it easy to accept payments on your site. The
        framework provides a simple way to get started with that, and a rich structure
        for extending usage for specific needs.
        
        GetPaid has been used in production since December 2007. Since then several
        improvements have occurred to keep the product improving and evolving. You can
        find a list of 15+ `Sites Using GetPaid`_, for examples of how it is used. For
        more about the project, including features, updates, and ways to contribute,
        please see our public web site, `www.plonegetpaid.com`_.

          [taito.horiuchi, fRiSi]
        
        - i18n.sh now updates plonegetpaid-plone.pot and takes
          actions.xml and portlets.xml into account, too.
        
          since the translators of zh and da added their translations
          manually which resulted in some ids being removed,
          so i did not update those
          [fRiSi]
        
        - updated German translation [fRiSi]
        
        - don't show the buy/donate/cart portlet when displaying the shopping cart
          or checkout forms
          (therefore added marker view IDontShowGetPaidPortlets)
          [fRiSi]
        
        - minor changes to the checkout-review-pay step so it does not require
          credit card information to create the order.

          `please review PloneGetPaid changes for a new paymentprocessor`
          on the developer list)

          [fRiSi]

          a newer version (this fixes #294)

          portlet and action.
          [jpg.rcom, davisagli, jesses, alext, cewing, larubbio]
