Description: Package for using GPTwoSample 
        =============================
        
        This module allows the user to compare two timelines with respect to
        diffferential expression.
        
        It compares two timeseries against each other, depicting whether these
        two timeseries were more likely drawn from the same function, or from
        different ones. This prediction is defined by which covariance
        function :py:class:`pygp.covar` you use.
        
        To use gptwosample without installing: $ python gptwosample --help
        
        To install gptwosample run: $ easy_install gptwosample or run:: $
        python setup.py install from gptwosample directory if you downloaded
        the source.  This will install a script gptwosample into your python
        bin. In some cases this bin is not in $PATH and must be included
        extra.
        
        Try printing the full help of the script using:: gptwosample --help
         restart your unix shell if it is not yet registered.
        
        To run optional package tests before installing run: python setup test
        
        After installation you can use GPTwoSample with all it's features.
        See doc/index.html for the documentation in your site-packages folder,
        see www.python.org for further details.
        
        Examples: Please see 'ready-to-use' example scripts in
        ./gptwosample/examples. (In your python site-packages folder, see
        www.python.org for further details)
        
        Example run: $ exdir=gptwosample/examples/ $ gptwosample -vtpo toy
        $exdir/ToyCondition1.csv $exdir/ToyCondition2.csv
        
        To see for example GPTimeShift example, run
        
        sh gptimeshift_example.sh
        
        The Output will be saved in gptimeshift_example/ with plots and
        results.csv. If you don't have sh, you can still run the script by
        modifying the scripts via "chmod -x gptimeshift_example.sh" and then
        run it by "./gptimeshift_example.sh"
        
        Make sure to run "python ./examples/generateToyExampleFiles.py" to
        generate toy data for examples, if they are not present.
