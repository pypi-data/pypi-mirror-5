Description: pypepa
        ======
        
        pypepa is a PEPA library and a toolset for `Performance Evaluation Process Algebra <http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/>`_ (PEPA) by Jane
        Hillston. pyPEPA is not a fully PEPA compatible tool, it supports a limited (for now) PEPA syntax (we only allow ``<>`` operator in system equation), i.e. it does not suport hiding operator (e.g. ``P\{a,b,}``), does not support rates as mathematical expressions (``r= 2*x+y``), does not calculate utilization or passage time. pyPEPA also does not use Kronecker state space representation and Hillston's aggregation algorithms, so it can have worse performance than the PEPA Eclipse Plugin.
        All these features, plus more, are planned to be added in next versions. Currently I am working on pyPEPA by myself only but if you are willing to help, just send an email to me or put a pull request. 
        
        **Warning: pyPEPA is under development, this is a beta software**
        
        
        pyPEPA consist of three parts:
        
        1. libpepa - a library written in python (mostly 3.3+ conformant)
        2. pyPEPA - a command line tool for solving and graphing
        3. distr/ - map reduce tools for solving large PEPA experiments

        You can calculate transient time proability for some number of time steps:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pypepa --transient 5 models/bankscenario.pepa
            
            Transient analysis from time 0 to 10
        
            Using ; delimiter
            1;Idle,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.08351202761947342
            2;Informed,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.2500169897974121
            3;WaitingBankResponse,RequestReceived,WaitingForEmployee;0.16662129023697114
            4;WaitingBankResponse,CustomerNotReliable,WaitingForEmployee;0.16657721277634494
            5;WaitingBankResponse,CustomerReliable,WaitingForEmployee;0.16657721277634485
            6;WaitingBankResponse,WaitingManagerResponse,EvaluatingOffer;0.08328947039778702
            7;OfferReceived,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.08340579639566591
            
        You can choose a solver by specifying ``--solver|-s {direct, sparse}``. By defalt we use sparse solver with LIL matrix becuase it is faster and in overall matrices generated from PEPA models are sparse. There is also an insignificant difference in results. 
        
        pypepa allows you to visualize all PEPA components by specifying ``-gd`` switch. The generated graphiz dot files are by deault saved in ``dots`` folder in the current directory. You can browse dot files with ``xdot``, which you need to install first. 
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pypepa -gd bankdots models/bankscenario.pepa
        
        
        Finally pypepa can provide us with a tool for experimentation with rates and actions. 
        Let's check how throughtput of ``askManager`` action changes when ``rateReset`` changes from 1 to 50 with step 1. The default result of this command will be a matplotlib graph.
        The format of ``-var`` is "vartype:varname:value range specifier:value range value". The one valid
        vartype for now is ``rate``, for value range specifiers you can choose: ``range`` or ``list``. For ``range``
        you need to provide START, STOP, STEP, whereas for `list` a comma separated list of values. 
        You can specify other output options with `-f` argument: graph, console, csv. 
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pypepa.py -var "rate:rateReset:range:1,50,1" -val askManager  models/bankscenario.pepa
        
        .. image:: https://raw.github.com/tdi/pypepa/dev/doc/bankexample.png
        
        
        Instead of ``--range`` you can specify ``--list`` with a custom comma delimited list of values. 
        
        Formatting
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can specify formats of ``-st``, ``-th`` and  ``--varrate`` with a ``--format`` option. 
        Currently we support CSV (although `;` not comma delimited), console (the default) and graph (only
        for varrate experiments). Additionally you can specify ``-o|--output`` option with a file argument to specify where to save the CSV. 
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pypepa -st models/bankscenario.pepa -f csv -o bank_steady.csv
