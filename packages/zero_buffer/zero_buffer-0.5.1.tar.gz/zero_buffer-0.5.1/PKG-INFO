        ``zero_buffer`` is a high-performance, zero-copy, implementation of a
        byte-buffer for Python.
        
        `Documentation`_ is available on ReadTheDocs.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from zero_buffer import Buffer
        
            # Create a buffer which has space for 8192 bytes.
            b = Buffer.allocate(8192)
            with open(path, "rb") as f:
                # Read up to 8192 bytes from the file into the buffer
                b.read_from(f.fileno())
            # Create a read-only view of the buffer, this performs no copying.
            view = b.view()
            # Split the view on colons, this returns a generator which yields sub-views
            # of the view.
            for part in view.split(b":"):
                print(part)
        
        ``zero_buffer`` works on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and PyPy.
