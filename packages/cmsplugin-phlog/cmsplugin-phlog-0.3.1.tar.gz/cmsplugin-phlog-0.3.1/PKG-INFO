Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is a `Django CMS` plugin for incorporating `photologue` galleries.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First, you must install `Django CMS` and `photologue` which require `Django` 
        and a few other libraries such as `PIL`. For full details, see the installation 
        instructions for those packages.
        
        Install ``cmsplugin-phlog`` to your environment with a tool such as `PIP`, 
        `setuptools`, or `buildout`.
        
        Add ``cmsplugin_phlog`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list in your project's 
        ``settings.py`` and run the ``syncdb`` command on your ``manage.py``.

        What's Inside
        -------------
        
        In order to facilitate ordering of the galleries on display, there is a new 
        `photologue` gallery with ordering support called ``OrderedGallery``. This model 
        can be linked using a CMS plugin to display photos on your page.
        
        The default rendering of the gallery plugin is an unordered list of images. This
        can be overridden by placing a template in your project's template folder at 
        ``cms/plugins/phlog/gallery.html`` to override all rendering or at 
        ``cms/plugins/phloge/{{ placeholder }}-gallery.html`` to override the template 
        for a single placeholder (by name).
