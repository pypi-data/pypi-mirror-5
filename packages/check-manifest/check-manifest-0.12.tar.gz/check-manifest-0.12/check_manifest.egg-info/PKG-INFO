        ==============

        Are you a Python developer?  Have you uploaded packages to the Python Package
        Index?  Have you accidentally uploaded *broken* packages with some files
        missing?  If so, check-manifest is for you.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install check-manifest
        
            $ cd ~/src/mygreatpackage
            $ check-manifest
        
        You can ask the script to help you update your MANIFEST.in::
        
            $ check-manifest -u
            listing source files under version control: 6 files and directories
            building an sdist: check-manifest-0.7.tar.gz: 4 files and directories
            files in version control do not match the sdist!
            missing from sdist:
              tests.py
              tox.ini
            suggested MANIFEST.in rules:
              include *.py
              include tox.ini
            updating MANIFEST.in
        
            $ cat MANIFEST.in
            include *.rst
        
            # added by check_manifest.py
            include *.py
            include tox.ini
        
        
        Command-line reference
        ----------------------
        
        ::
        
            $ check-manifest --help
            usage: check-manifest [-h] [-c] [-u] [source_tree]
        
            Check a Python MANIFEST.in file for completeness
        
            positional arguments:
              source_tree   location for the source tree (default: .)
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help    show this help message and exit
              -c, --create  create a MANIFEST.in if missing (default: False)
              -u, --update  append suggestions to MANIFEST.in (implies --create) (default:
                            False)
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        You can tell check-manifest to ignore certain file patterns by adding a
        ``check-manifest`` section to your package's ``setup.cfg``.  Example::
        
            [check-manifest]
            ignore =
                .travis.yml
        
        The following options are recognized:
        
        ignore
            A list of newline separated filename patterns that will be ignored by
            check-manifest.  Use this if you want to keep files in your version
            control system that shouldn't be included in your source distributions.
            The default ignore list is ::
        
                PKG-INFO
                *.egg-info
                *.egg-info/*
                setup.cfg
                .hgtags
                .hgignore
                .gitignore
                .bzrignore
                *.mo
        
        ignore-default-rules
            If set to ``true``, your ``ignore`` patterns will replace the default
            ignore list instead of adding to it.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        0.12 (2013-05-15)
        -----------------
        
        * Add suggestion pattern for `Makefile`.
        
        * More generic suggestion patterns, should cover almost anything.
        
        * zest.releaser_ integration: skip check-release for non-Python packages
          (`issue #9 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/9>`__).
        
        
        0.11 (2013-03-20)
        -----------------
        
        * Make sure ``MANIFEST.in`` is not ignored even if it hasn't been added to the
          VCS yet (`issue #7 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/7>`__).
        
        
        0.10 (2013-03-17)
        -----------------
        
        * ``check-manifest --version`` now prints the version number.
        
        * Don't apologize for not adding rules for directories (especially after adding
          rules that include files inside that directory).
        
        * Python 3 support contributed by Steven Myint.
        
        * Default ignore patterns can be configured in ``setup.cfg``
          (`issue #3 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/3>`_).
        
        
        0.9 (2013-03-06)
        ----------------
        
        * Add suggestion pattern for `.travis.yml`.
        
        * When check-manifest -u (or -c) doesn't know how to write a rule matching a
          particular file, it now apologizes explicitly.
        
        * Copy the source tree to a temporary directory before running python setup.py
          sdist to avoid side effects from setuptools plugins or stale
          \*.egg-info/SOURCES.txt files
          (`issue #1 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/1>`_).
        
        * Warn if `*.egg-info` or `*.mo` is actually checked into the VCS.
        
        * Don't complain if `*.mo` files are present in the sdist but not in the VCS
          (`issue #2 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/2>`_).
        
        
        0.8 (2013-03-06)
        ----------------
        
        * Entry point for zest.releaser_.  If you install both zest.releaser and
          check-manifest, you will be asked if you want to check your manifest during
          ``fullrelease``.
        
        .. _zest.releaser: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser
        
        
        0.7 (2013-03-05)
        ----------------
        
        * First release available from the Python Package Index.
        
        * Moved from https://gist.github.com/4277075
          to https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest
        
        * Added README.rst, CHANGES.rst, setup.py, tox.ini (but no real tests yet),
          MANIFEST.in, and a Makefile.
        
        * Fixed a bug in error reporting (when setup.py failed, the user would get
          `TypeError: descriptor '__init__' requires a 'exceptions.Exception' object
          but received a 'str'`).
