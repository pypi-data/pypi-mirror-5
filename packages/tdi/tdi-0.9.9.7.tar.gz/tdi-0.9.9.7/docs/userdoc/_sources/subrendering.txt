 Sub-Rendering
===============

Sub-rendering means, that you can prematurely render a node during the
regular rendering process (i.e. from within a :samp:`render_{name}`
method). This is useful if you want to process the render result before
actually emitting it to the output stream. Sub-rendering is implemented
by the node's :tdi:`tdi.nodetree.Node./render` method.


Placing a HTML Node Into a Javascript Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That's a typical use case. Imagine you have a piece of HTML code, that
only makes sense if javascript is enabled, or just a fragment that you
need later in your script. |TDI| cannot render HTML within a javascript
block (because it's just a piece of text from |TDI|\'s point of view).

The following example shows how to render the HTML in the regular
template context and then remove it (using :ref:`the content picking
method with node.replace() <content_picking>`) and placing it in the
javascript content afterwards. It's surprisingly simple, given that this
explanation takes much more space than the code itself:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/subrender.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: BEGIN INCLUDE

The example produces the following output:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/out/subrender.out
    :language: html

The code uses the :func:`javascript.fill` function, which is part of the
:doc:`javascript tools <javascript_tools>`.

Also note, how contents of the node is rendered using the model.
The options of the :meth:`render()` method are :tdi:`described in the API
documentation <tdi.nodetree.Node.render>`.
