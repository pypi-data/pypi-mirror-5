        jusText
        =======
        jusText is a tool for removing boilerplate content, such as navigation links,
        headers, and footers from HTML pages. It is designed to preserve mainly text
        containing full sentences and it is therefore well suited for creating
        linguistic resources such as Web corpora. You can `try it online <http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projects/justext/>`_.
        
        This is the a fork of original code of jusText_ hosted on Google code. Below are some "forks" that I found on GitHub:

        - https://github.com/says/justext
