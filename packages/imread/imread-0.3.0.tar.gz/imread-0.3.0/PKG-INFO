Description: ================================
        mahotas-imread: Read Image Files
        ================================
        
        Mahotas-imread is a simple module with a small number of functions:
        
        imread
            Reads an image file
        imread_multi
            Reads an image file with multiple images. Currently, TIFF and STK (a TIFF
            sub-based format) support this function.
        imsave
            Writes an image file
        
        Example (which uses `mahotas <http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas>`__ for
        Gaussian filtering)::
        
        
            from imread import imread, imsave
            from mahotas import gaussian_filter
            lena = imread('lena.jpeg')
        
            lena = gaussian_filter(lena.astype(float), 4.)
            imsave('lena-filtered.jpeg', lena)
        
        
        This grew out of frustration at current image loading solutions in Python, in
        either my packages [`mahotas <http://mahotas.rtfd.org>`__] or packages from
        others [`scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`__, for example].
        
        The relationship with numpy is very contained and this could be easily
        repurposed to load images in other frameworks, even other programming
        languages.

        Python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 are officially supported.
        
        Python 3.4 should also work (submit a bug report if it does not). Python 3.2
        (and earlier versions in the Python 3 series) are officially **not supported**.
