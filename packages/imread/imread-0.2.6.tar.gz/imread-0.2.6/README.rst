========================
imread: Read Image Files
========================

Simple module with a small number of functions:

imread
    Reads an image file
imread_multi
    Reads an image file with multiple images. Currently, TIFF and STK (a TIFF
    sub-based format) support this function.
imsave
    Writes an image file

Example (which uses `mahotas <http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas>`__ for
Gaussian filtering)::


    from imread import imread, imsave
    from mahotas import gaussian_filter
    lena = imread('lena.jpeg')

    lena = gaussian_filter(lena.astype(float), 4.)
    imsave('lena-filtered.jpeg', lena)


This grew out of frustration at current image loading solutions in Python, in
either my packages [mahotas] or packages from others [scikits.image, for
example].

The relationship with numpy is very contained and this could be easily
repurposed to load images in other frameworks, even other programming
languages.

Bug Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~

Please report any bugs either on github or by email to luis@luispedro.org

If you are not sure of whether this is the correct behaviour, you can discuss
this on the
`pythonvision mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pythonvision>`__

If at all possible, include a small image as a test case.
