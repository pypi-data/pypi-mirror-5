Bugjar Roadmap
==============

Bugjar is a new project - we have lots of things that we'd like to do. If
you'd like to contribute, providing a patch for one of these features:

 * Port to Python 3

 * Add the ability to browse objects in the stack

 * Add the ability to add user-defined expressions to watch.
