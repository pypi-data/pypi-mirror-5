Description: Bugjar
        ======
        
        Bugjar is part of the `BeeWare suite`_. The project website is
        `http://pybee.org/bugjar`_.
        
        Anyone who learned to code in the mid to late 80s probably spent some
        time with a Borland compiler -- probably either Turbo Pascal or Turbo C.
        One of the best features of the Turbo compilers was their IDE -- and
        in particular, a really good visual debugger that would let you inspect
        code while it was running.
        
        Then we all moved to Unix, and somehow forgot what a good debugger was.
        GDB is perfectly functional, but isn't very intuitive. GDB gives you
        perfect control over the execution of your code, but bad contextual
        information to let you know what control you should be exercising.
        
        Then came Python. Python's execution model contains excellent debugging
        hooks, and supplies PDB as a proof of concept. PDB is an interface that
        shares many similarities with GDB -- text mode, fantastic control, but
        very bad contextual information.
        
        So - enter ``bugjar``. A graphical interface for debugging code.
        PDB, but with the context to help you step through code in a meaningful way.

        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Bugjar can be installed with pip:
        
            $ pip install bugjar
        
        You can then debug a Python script by typing the following at a shell prompt:
        
            $ bugjar myscript.py arg1 arg2
        
        This will start a graphical interface, with ``myscript.py`` loaded into the
        source code window. You can set (or remove) breakpoints by clicking on line
        numbers; you can step through and into code; or you can set the program
        running unconstrained. Each time the debugger stops at a breakpoint, the
        inspector will be updated with the current contents of locals, globals, and
        builtins.
        
        The Python script will run using your current environment; if you have an
        active virtualenv, that environment will be current.
        
        When you quit the debugger, the script will be terminated.
