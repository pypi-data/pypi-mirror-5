Changelog
=========

1.7.3 (2013-08-14)
------------------

- On KSS Validation, pass REQUEST to validate method.
  Without it, it can happen that the language negociator chooses
  a different language for error messages than the regular form validation.
  This can result in error messages in different languages for kss
  and normal form validation.

1.7.2 (2012-05-25)
------------------


1.7.1 (2011-07-19)
------------------

- The change r12412 in 1.6.0a3 introduced a regression,
  the field inline validating error message was not shown to the user.
  The error message is not always the "required field" message, so it's
  problematic to not show the error message in all cases.
  The warning_only parameter is now set to False in the issueFieldError call so
  the error message appears again.

1.7.0 (2011-01-03)
------------------

- Use plone.uuid to look up content UUIDs.
  [toutpt, davisagli]

1.6.0 (2010-07-31)
------------------

- Calling it a 1.6.0 final, no changes since b1.
  [esteele]

1.6.0b1 (2010-05-01)
--------------------

- Check for inline editing status on an actual field in the content-core, not
  title which is now rendered by hand.
  [davisagli]

1.6.0a3 (2010-03-09)
--------------------

- Made error message be a warning instead before the form has been submitted,
  this causes less disruption in a form while editing.
  [joelburton]


1.6.0a2 (2010-03-09)
--------------------

- Fixed test failure in testVersionPreviewIsNotInlineEditable.
  [hannosch]

1.6.0a1 (2009-11-19)
--------------------

- Fixed validation test to work with plone.app.blob files.

- Updated reference to IATDocument from Products.ATContentTypes to the
  standard location.
  [hannosch]

1.4.3 (2008-11-02)
------------------

- Enable unlock on unload for inline edits.
  [alecm]

1.4.2 (2008-08-18)
------------------

- Using an adapter to determine whether inline editing is enabled, so
  the default behaviour can easily be overridden.
  [fschulze]

- Added check for site_property 'enable_inline_editing'. This is a global
  setting which can still be overwritten with kss_inline_editable.
  [fschulze]

- Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
  since we changed the version numbering again.
  [hannosch]

1.4 (2008-04-21)
----------------

- test on global_inline_editable should happen only in
  getKssClassesInlineEditable()
  Fixed disabling of inline editing
  [fschulze]

- Some Archetypes-validators expect the request 
  as a keyword argument. Fixes #8005.
  [mborch]

1.2.6 (2008-01-03)
------------------

- Fixed i18n markup in fields_versioning.py.
  [hannosch]

1.2.5 (2008-01-03)
------------------

- Changed 'saveField' to not require 'value' explicitly
  but to take it from the request if missing.
  This was done to support the use of 
  saveField-kssSubmitForm: currentForm();
  which is needed for multi-valued form variables.
  [raphael]

1.2.4.1 (2007-12-07)
--------------------

- Handle aborted versioning due to exceedingly 
  large files.
  (Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7236)
  [alecm]

1.2-1 (2007-09-10)
------------------

- UID refactoring for fields (inline editing) support
  [mborch]

- Make sure inline edit is not active in the versioning preview. 
  (fixes #6958). From now on, the kss_inline_editable
  variable can be defined to False in a template and this will
  cause the contained widgets to be not inline editable
  even though their condition would allow it.
  [ree]

- implement versioning work with inline edit (fixes #6938)
  [ree]
