    Correct concatenation of string and int object
    
    Straightforward change, a mistake was made with a string and an int
    was concatenated.

    Expose wait_for_rsp class method via public classes.
    
    In complicated uses of pyghmi, it becomes useful to call into the
    otherwise private event loop iteration.  This exposes the
    wait_for_rsp method so that it may be consumed without violating
    the expectations of private.

    In changing to select, the nature of the return value failed.
    When using poll(), we got file descriptor number.  However select
    provides the object and so we have to consult the fileno() method.

    poll is not available in all platforms.  Additionally, eventlet
    does not handle poll in a monkey patching scenario.  Use select()
    as the greatest common factor.

    Enhance wait behavior of set_power
    
    Previously, wait would always be indefinite and act in many ways like
    a busy wait.  The check for completion now takes one second between
    every check.  The default behavior now goes for 300 seconds, but
    wait can now take an int to indicate a different preference by the
    caller.  300 seconds may seem like a lot, but the 'softoff' request
    in particular suggests waiting for OS shutdown process to complete.
    
    Additionally, some bugs in the retry logic were noted in the process
    of having the retry timer drive the delay and are corrected.

    Rename to pyghmi
    
    It has been expressed as a concern that 'ipmi' is too generic a name.
    Additionally, it is also the case that non-ipmi capability is likely
    to be incorporated as it goes along (e.g. Enclosure management and
    virtual media are frequently not IPMI based).
    
    Move existing content under the 'pyghmi' namespace.  pyghmi stands for
    'python general hardware management infrastructure' and is pronounced
    'pygmy'

    Remove callback arguments from most functions.
    
    After some contemplation, I realized that given the underlying behavior of 'wait_for_rsp', that
    synchronous and asynchronous calls play well with each other.  The pattern of considering an 'onlogon'
    function as running in a sort of greenthread works well and leads to much more comprehensible code
    for the average person.  While removing those arguments, the module contents were reorganized to
    serve as an example of how more straightforward code written in this fashion may be.

    Change session timer to monotonic when possible
    
    Previously the ipmi session was using time.time().  This means
    that retries and keepalives could be thrown off by things like ntp
    or manual time corrections.
    
    Ideally, we'd use the baked in time.monotonic(), but that doesn't exist
    aside from python 3.3

    The interval is randomized to mitigate risk of some synchronized activity

    seconds within reason within the constraints of the spec.
