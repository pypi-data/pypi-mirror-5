both of which can be obtained from your registered application at https://dev.twitter.com/apps

Usage

This command will open a twitter authentication page asking for your permission,
and then presenting a 7-digit pincode if you permit it. Feed ptwit the pincode to finish the login process.

   ptwit timeline

Get someone's tweets::

Commands above always list the latest 20 new tweets, which means the tweets you've fetched will not be listed again.

Post a new tweet::
