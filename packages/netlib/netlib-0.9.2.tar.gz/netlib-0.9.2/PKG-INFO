Description: 
        Netlib is a collection of network utility classes, used by the pathod and
        mitmproxy projects. It differs from other projects in some fundamental
        respects, because both pathod and mitmproxy often need to violate standards.
        This means that protocols are implemented as small, well-contained and flexible
        functions, and are designed to allow misbehaviour when needed.
