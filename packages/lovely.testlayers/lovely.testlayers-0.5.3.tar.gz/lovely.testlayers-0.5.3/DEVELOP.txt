=======================================
Development setup for lovely.testlayers
=======================================

This project uses buildout, so in order to start developing run the
following in this directory::

 python bootstrap.py
 ./bin/buildout

To run tests use::

 ./bin/test

Note that some tests require internet access and are not run by
default. To run all tests use::

 ./bin/test --all


MongoDB
-------

The mongodb tests are separated and by default not included if buildout is run.
To install mongodb execute::

    bin/buildout install mongodb mongodb-test

And then run the tests with::

    bin/test-mongodb --suite-name=mongodb_suite
