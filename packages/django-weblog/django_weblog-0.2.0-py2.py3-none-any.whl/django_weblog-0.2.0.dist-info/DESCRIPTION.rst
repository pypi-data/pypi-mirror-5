Django Weblog
=============



Requirements
------------

This app is tested with Django 1.1. It might also work with older versions, but
I haven’t tested it.

If you want to run the tests, you’ll need to install `Mock
<http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/>`_.

There are no other requirements.


Installation
------------

If you read this, you have probably managed to extract the archive containing
these files. Next, open a Terminal and `cd` to the directory containing this
file (e.g. ``cd ~/Downloads/django-weblog``). Then execute::

    python setup.py install

If you checked out the repository and always want to use the newest version,
type::

    pip install -e path/to/django-weblog


Usage
-----

The Documentation can be found in the *docs/* directory or
`online <http://stefan.sofa-rockers.org/docs/django-weblog/>`_.
