        snippet
        =======
        
        This is a "cms.plugins.snippet" (from djangocms) clone to extend it with some facilities
        
        Original code is from the original `DjangoCMS`_ plugin.
        
        Changes from original code
        --------------------------
        
        This clone try to change as few orignal code as possible, actually the differences are :
        
        * Adding a template tag to directly use snippet fragments in the templates, not only from CMS pages;
        
        Requires
        --------
        
        * `DjangoCMS`_ version >= 2.3 (tested with 2.3.6) (should not work with >= 3.x);
        
        Previously it required `djangocms_text_ckeditor <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-text-ckeditor>`_, but it has been deprecated, wyswyg is not really useful for snippet where we need to insert any valid HTML. Something more accurate like Codemirror should be used instead in the future.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        The only thing needed is to replace the ``cms.plugins.snippet`` in your `DjangoCMS`_ settings, like this : ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'cms',
                # Plugins
                ...
                #'cms.plugins.snippet',
                'snippet', # the snippet plugin clone
                ...
            )
        
        Because the code is cloned from the original plugin with just a few changes, all CMS stuff should work as with the original plugin, you should even add it in an existing install without loss in database and without any syncdb.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Template tags
        .............
        
        Use the template tags in your templates : ::
        
            {% load snippet_tags %}
            {% snippet_fragment [Snippet ID or instance] %}
        
        Like this : ::
        
            {% load snippet_tags %}
            {% snippet_fragment 42 %}
            
        The required argument is for the Snippet ID or a Snippet instance if you want.
