Description: ====================
        django-shop-viveum
        ====================
        
        This module is a payment backend module for django-SHOP (https://github.com/divio/django-shop),
        using Viveum (https://viveum.v-psp.com) as the shops payment service provider.
        It can be used for credit card and other kind of payments.
        
        Currently only payment methods are implemented, which do not require a PCI DSS certification
        (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) for your shop. This means that your shop never "sees" the
        credit card numbers, and thus can not store and in consequence abuse them.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Using pip::
        
            pip install django-shop-viveum
        
        Viveum Configuration
        ====================
        
        Get in touch with Viveum and ask for a test account. They will send you an identifier
        and a password. Use the given values and log into
        https://viveum.v-psp.com/ncol/test/admin_viveum.asp
        this will bring you into an admin backend. All the relevant settings required to configure this
        module can be fetched from the menu item
        **Configuration > Technical information > Global security parameters**::
            Hash algorithm: SHA-1
            Character encoding: UTF-8
            Enable JavaScript check on template: Yes
            Allow usage of static template: Yes
        
        Generate a 16 digit SHA-IN and a 12 digit SHA-OUT random pass phrase (``base64``
        and ``/dev/urandom`` are your friends) and copy them into the given fields at
        **Configuration > Technical information > Data and origin verification > SHA-IN pass phrase**::
        
        **Configuration > Technical information > Transaction feedback**::
            YES, I would like to receive transaction feedback parameters on the redirection URLs.
            YES, I would like VIVEUM to display a short text to the customer on the secure payment page
            Timing of the request: Always online
            Request method: GET
            Dynamic e-Commerce parameters Selected:
                ACCEPTANCE
                AMOUNT
                BRAND
                CARDNO
                CN
                CURRENCY
                IP
                NCERROR
                ORDERID
                PAYID
                STATUS
        
            SHA-OUT pass phrase: (as above)
        
        Test the Configuration
        ======================
        In order to run the unit tests, you must install an additional Python package,
        which is not required for normal operation::
        
            pip install requests
        
        Unfortunately there might be an unresolved issue with SSL on requests. Please read
        docs/ssl-problem.rst for details.
        
        Run ``./runtests.sh``.
        If everything worked fine, you should receive two emails, one for a successful,
        and one for a declined payment.
        If there is an error, check the error log at the Viveum admin interface.
        
        Test cards
        ==========
        During manual testing, you may not want to use a real credit card number. Here are a few official
        credit card numbers for testing:
        
        * VISA: 4111111111111111 with any expiry date in the future and any 3 digit security code.
        * A number of a "stolen" card: 4111113333333333 – payment shall be refused.
        
        
        Use these settings in your shop Configuration
        =============================================
        If all tests work fine, use these tested settings for your production environment.
        
        * In Viveums admin interface, transfer your test account settings to production.
        * In your project setting.py
          * add ``viveum``, to INSTALLED_APPS.
          * add ``synthesa.payment.backends.ViveumPaymentBackend`` to SHOP_PAYMENT_BACKENDS.
          * copy the content of ``tests/viveum_settings.py`` into the ``settings.py`` file of
            your project. In dict ``VIVEUM_PAYMENT`` change 
            ``ORDER_STANDARD_URL`` to ``https://viveum.v-psp.com/ncol/prod/orderstandard_UTF8.asp``
