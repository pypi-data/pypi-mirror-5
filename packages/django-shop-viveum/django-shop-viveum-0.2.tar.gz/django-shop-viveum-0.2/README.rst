====================
django-shop-viveum
====================

This module is a payment backend module for django-SHOP (https://github.com/divio/django-shop),
using Viveum (https://viveum.v-psp.com) as the shops payment service provider.
It can be used for credit card and other kind of payments.

Currently only payment methods are implemented, which do not require a PCI DSS
certification (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) for your shop.
This means that your shop never "sees" the credit card numbers, and thus can not
store and/or abuse it.

Installation
============
Using pip::

    pip install django-shop-viveum

Viveum Configuration
====================

Get in touch with Viveum and ask for a test account. They will send you an identifier
and a password. Use the given values and log into
https://viveum.v-psp.com/ncol/test/admin_viveum.asp
this will bring you into a old-fashioned admin environment. All the relevant settings 
required to configure this module can be fetched from the menu item
**Configuration > Technical information > Global security parameters**::
    Hash algorithm: SHA-1
    Character encoding: UTF-8
    Enable JavaScript check on template: Yes

Test the Configuration
======================

In order to run the unit tests, you must install an additional Python package,
which is not required for normal operation::

    pip install requests

Unfortunately there might be an unresolved issue with SSL on requests. Please read
docs/ssl-problem.rst for details.

Run ``./runtests.sh``.
If everything worked fine, you should receive two emails, one for a successful,
and one for a declined payment.
If there is an error, check the error log at the Viveum admin interface.

Use these settings in your shop Configuration
=============================================
If all tests work fine, use these tested settings for your production environment.

* In Viveums admin interface, transfer your test account settings to production.
* In your project setting.py
  * add ``viveum``, to INSTALLED_APPS.
  * add ``synthesa.payment.backends.ViveumPaymentBackend`` to SHOP_PAYMENT_BACKENDS.
  * copy the content of ``tests/viveum_settings.py`` into the ``settings.py`` file of
    your project. In dict ``VIVEUM_PAYMENT`` change 
    ``ORDER_STANDARD_URL`` to ``https://viveum.v-psp.com/ncol/prod/orderstandard_UTF8.asp``
