Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.geo.file provides a view for KML, KMZ (Keyhole Markup Language)
        and GPX (GPS eXchange Format) files.
        The view renders the file in a openlayers Map using the collective.geo
        library.
        
        The product does not introduce a content type but adds an additional
        view to the Archetypes file and collection type.
        
        When you upload a file with the
        correct mimetype 'application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml' (i.e with
        the extension `*.kml`), 'application/vnd.google-earth.kmz' (extension
        `*.kmz`)
        or 'application/gpx+xml' (i.e. with the extension
        `*.gpx`) the map view will be applied by default.
        
        KML, KMZ and GPX files are displayed in the `KML Openlayers View` of
        collections and Folders
        
        
        
        
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
        If you assign coordinates to the file with the IGeoreferenceable Interface
        you have to set the viewletmanager to 'Do not display map' otherwise
        it will **REALLY** screw up your view. The coordinates assigned there
        will display as the first layer on the 'Map View' of the file and
        they will display in the 'KML File Map View' of a topic.
