Description: About TGApp-Smallpress
        -------------------------
        
        SmallPress is a Pluggable Minimalistic Blog for TurboGears2.
        It implements articles with Attachments and Tags support.
        Uses CKEditor for content editing.
        
        Installing
        -------------------------------
        
        tgapp-smallpress can be installed both from pypi or from bitbucket::
        
            easy_install tgapp-smallpress
        
        should just work for most of the users
        
        Plugging Smallpress
        ----------------------------
        
        In your application *config/app_cfg.py* import **plug**::
        
            from tgext.pluggable import plug
        
        Then at the *end of the file* call plug with smallpress::
        
            plug(base_config, 'smallpress')
        
        Run **paster setup-app development.ini** again to create
        the tables related to smallpress and start the application.
        You will be able to access the blog section at
        *http://localhost:8080/smallpress*. Management gui
        will be available when logged with an user inside
        the *smallpress* Group.
        
        Enabling Whoosh Indexing
        ----------------------------
        
        SmallPress has bult in posts indexing whoosh based.
        If you have Whoosh installed it will be used to perform indexing of
        the articles for better lookup in search functions.
        
        When enabled Whoosh will store its index into */tmp/smallpress_whoosh*
        you can change this path by changing the `smallpress_whoosh_index`
        variable in your configuration file.
        
        Multiple Blogs Support
        ---------------------------
        
        By default smallpress will work with only one blog, but it supports
        a preliminary multiple blogs implementation. Search and TagCloud will
        be shared by all the blogs, but it is possible to filter the articles
        of only one blog and manage only its articles.
        
        To create a blog access */smallpress/blogs* and create a new one,
        you will then be able to access the subblog and manage it by accessing
        */smallpress/blogname*
        
        Exposed Partials
        ----------------------
        
        Smallpress exposed a bunch of partials which can be used
        to render pieces of the blogging system anywhere in your
        application:
