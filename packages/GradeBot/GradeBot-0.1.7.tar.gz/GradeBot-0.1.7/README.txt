GradeBot by AlexKang

This is my first project in Python. It is a grade report generator and a GPA calculator.

You can store the name of courses you are taking, the grades of those courses, and the units those courses are worth. They are stored in a dictionary which is saved into a .txt file using the json module.

With this information, you can print your grade report with letter grades and calculate your college GPA.
There is also a function to calculate your required grade on a final to get your desired letter grade.

To start the program, simply type "gradebot" into your terminal.

Note: When loading your profile, you must enter your name exactly as how you entered it when you created it. It is case-sensitive. The .txt file is saved in the directory where you are running the program.
