Sourcefabric's Live Blog is an open source web app that lets you create and
update live blogs in seconds.

Breaking news situations and major scheduled events like a football match
require immediate and ongoing reporting. Your readers want to receive
minute-by-minute updates, sometimes using their mobile phone as a second
screen while watching events. Sourcefabric's Live Blog is an open source
web app built for this purpose. It lets you create and update live blogs
in seconds with videos, images, and audio from your reporters, newswires
and the social web. Live Blog integrates effortlessly with your existing
CMS. You can customise its design to match your website. And because it's
an open source tool, you will always have complete control over the software
code and your content.
