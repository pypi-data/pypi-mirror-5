v0.1.0b2, 2013.08 
    
    * This release is not backwards compatible with 0.1.0b1. Several changes
      were made which broke compatibility in the storage formats, and the 
      API also changed in significant ways. Hopefully this will be the last
      time this needs to happen.
    
    * Added support for half-precision floats based on NumPy's halffloat.[c,h].
