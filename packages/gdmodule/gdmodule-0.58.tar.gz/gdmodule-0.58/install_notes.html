<h1>gd module install notes</h1>

<p>
I'm going to assume that you've got the GD library installed, which is 
pretty trivial to do. If you're having troubles with that, I suggest 
you have a look at that package's instructions.

<p>
Starting with version 0.40 of gdmodule, the Setup.py script tries rather hard to
identify installed libraries.  Assuming you have GD installed normally, with
development versions of all the libraries it uses, you are in good shape.  If
you have build problems or runtime errors mentioning unknown functions, you
probably either (a) don't have all the supporting libraries installed as
development versions, or (b) have libraries installed that weren't used to build
GD!

<p>
Libraries looked for are: X11, Xpm, png, z, jpeg, ttf, and/or freetype.  If both
libttf and libfreetype are found, the libfreetype wins.  If either libpng or
libz are missing, png support is not built; likewise for Xpm and X11.

<p>
Installation is done via the standard Distutils.  Do this (as root if necessary):

<blockquote><code>
    python Setup.py install
</code></blockquote>

<p>
This should build the _gd.so extension and install it along with the gd.py
module in the standard location on your system.

<p>
If you have had a previous version of gdmodule installed, in particular one
which creates a monolithic gdmodule.so or gd.so, please remove it before
building this one.

<p>
As of right now, I don't have a build for Windows.  If I get time I might
put one together... don't hold your breath.  (If someone wants to build one for
me I wouldn't cry about it...)
