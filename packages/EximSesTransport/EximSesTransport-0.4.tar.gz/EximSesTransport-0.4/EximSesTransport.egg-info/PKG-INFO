Description: Amazon's cloud includes a service to send e-mail through their infrastructure.
        While this is useful, sometimes there's just no substitute for an MTA.  This
        transport allows you to selectively integrate Amazon's SES with one of the
        Internet's most powerful MTAs, Exim.
