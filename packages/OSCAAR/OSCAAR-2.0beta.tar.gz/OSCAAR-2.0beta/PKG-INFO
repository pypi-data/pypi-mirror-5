Description: OSCAAR 2.0 BETA
        
        OSCAAR is the Open Source differential photometry 
        Code for Accelerating Amateur Research, or Open 
        Source differential photometry Code for Amateur 
        Astronomical Research, or various other rotating 
        alternative fun acronyms. 
        
        OSCAAR is a differential photometry package 
        written in Python created by Brett M. Morris 
        (NASA GSFC/UMD). Among other things, OSCAAR's 
        mission to bring easily readable yet powerful
        photometry code to inexperienced programmers via
        user-friendly GUIs, and also to provide a modular, 
        object-oriented scaffolding upon which custom 
        photometry pipelines can be developed by advanced
        coders. 
        
        Dependencies: Python 2.7, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib,
            pyFITS, wxPython (and optionally PyEphem)
        
        For details in installation, check out the INSTALL 
        file in this directory.
