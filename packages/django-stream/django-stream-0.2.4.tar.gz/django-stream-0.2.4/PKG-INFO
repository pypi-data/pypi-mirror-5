        =============
        
        `|Build Status| <https://travis-ci.org/caffeinehit/django-stream>`_
        
        django-stream provides activity streams for Django applications.
        
        It differs from
        `django-activity-stream <https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream>`_
        in that it does not use generic relations and does not provide a
        ``Follow`` object, but it can be used together with
        `django-follow <https://github.com/caffeinehit/django-follow>`_.
        
        The motivation to not use generic relations is for simplicity reasons.
