Description: Graphite AWS Cleaner
        ====================
        
        Delete old graphite data based on instance name pattern and current
        running AWS instances.
        
        This is very useful if you have AWS instances that are terminated and
        you no longer need their metrics, so you can just remove their stats.
        
        It is required to have AWS credentials set via environment variables
        (``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``) or IAM roles.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install graphite_aws_cleaner
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            # aws context
            web_i-123 # running
            web_i-456 # running
            web_i-789 # terminated
        
        
            $ graphite-aws-cleaner '*web*' /opt/graphite/storage
        
        This is going to delete all graphite data related to ``web_i-789``,
        since the instance is no longer runnning.
        
        Patterns
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Anything that matches Python's
        `fnmatch.fnmatch <http://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.html>`_
        works as a pattern:
        
        +-------------+------------------------------------+
        | Pattern     | Meaning                            |
        +=============+====================================+
        | \*          | matches everything                 |
        +-------------+------------------------------------+
        | ?           | matches any single character       |
        +-------------+------------------------------------+
        | [seq]       | matches any character in seq       |
        +-------------+------------------------------------+
        | [!seq]      | matches any character not in seq   |
        +-------------+------------------------------------+
