Description: Reddit Ripper
        =============
        
        So, you are busy with the stuff, but don't want to miss a picture in
        gonewild^Wmotivationalpics? Then, this is the project for you.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You will need to have Redis instance ready. Then, the fastest way is to pip it:
        
            pip install reddrip
        
        Pip will download and install the dependencies for you.
        
        Running
        -------
        
        What you need is a configuration file. Take a look at ``example.cfg`` one to get
        the idea.
        
        After that, run it:
        
            reddrip run -c /path/to/configuration.cfg
        
        Also, you may use ``-v`` to get more verbosity.
        
        At any moment, you may query Redis database to get some stats:
        
            reddrip stat -c /path/to/configuration.cfg
        
        History
        -------
        
        This code was born one evening after playing with ``praw``.
