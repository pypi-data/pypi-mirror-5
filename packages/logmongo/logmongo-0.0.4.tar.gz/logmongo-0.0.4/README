Installation
=================

easy_install logmongo

What does it do?
=====================

* Gracefully creates capped collections.
* Auto expires oldest records first and solves log rotation.
* Writes complex (dicts and kwargs) log records.
* Logs asynchronously.
* Collects logs locally or remotely or in a central location.
* Allows access to logs via MongoDB queries and APIs. 

Why should I use Logmongo instead of just pymongo?
=====================================================

Logmongo subclasses the pymongo Collection object and 
provides the following additions -

A new Logmongo object will:
 * gracefully create a named capped collection 
 * allow a max size to be specified

write method which:
 * logs all passed keywords
 * adds current time to record
 * adds hostname to record

query method which:
 * allows keywords (kwargs) querying
   example: log.query( tags='finance' )

tail method which:
 * prints all records that match query until killed

How does it work?
=====================

Example::

 from logmongo import Logmongo

 log = Logmongo()

 log.write( message='No required kwargs or fields!' )

 entry = {
   'tags':['but','we','like','tags'],
   'level':'info'
 }
 log.write( entry )
