        ==============
        
        Python framework for dataflow-style programs.
        
        Users of this framework structure their code into blocks with named inputs and outputs that are connected
        by channels. A typical application will have one or more data generator/importer blocks which then pass 
        their data through various blocks which apply filters or tranforms to operate on the data.
