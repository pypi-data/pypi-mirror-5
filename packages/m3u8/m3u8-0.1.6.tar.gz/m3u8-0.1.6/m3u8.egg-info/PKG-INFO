        Python `m3u8`_ parser.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The basic usage is to create a playlist object from uri, file path or
        directly from a string:
        
        ::
        
            import m3u8
        
            m3u8_obj = m3u8.load('http://videoserver.com/playlist.m3u8')  # this could also be an absolute filename
            print m3u8_obj.segments
            print m3u8_obj.target_duration
        
            # if you already have the content as string, use
        
            m3u8_obj = m3u8.loads('#EXTM3U8 ... etc ... ')
        
        Encryption key
        --------------
        
        The segments may be encrypted, in this case the ``key`` attribute will
        be an object with all the attributes from `#EXT-X-KEY`_:
        
        -  ``method``: ex.: "AES-128"
        -  ``uri``: the key uri, ex.: "http://videoserver.com/key.bin"
        -  ``iv``: the initialization vector, if available. Otherwise ``None``.
        
        If no ``#EXT-X-KEY`` is found, the ``key`` attribute will be ``None``.
        
        Multiple keys are not supported yet (and has a low priority), follow
        `issue 1`_ for updates.
        
        Variant playlists (variable bitrates)
        -------------------------------------
        
        A playlist can have a list to other playlist files, this is used to
        represent multiple bitrates videos, and it's called `variant streams`_.
        See an `example here`_.
        
        ::
        
            variant_m3u8 = m3u8.loads('#EXTM3U8 ... contains a variant stream ...')
            variant_m3u8.is_variant    # in this case will be True
        
            for playlist in variant_m3u8.playlists:
                playlist.uri
                playlist.stream_info.bandwidth
        
        the playlist object used in the for loop above has a few attributes:
        
        -  ``uri``: the url to the stream
        -  ``stream_info``: a ``StreamInfo`` object (actually a namedtuple) with
           all the attributes available to `#EXT-X-STREAM-INF`_
        
        **NOTE: the following attributes are not implemented yet**, follow
        `issue 4`_ for updates
        
        -  ``iframe_stream_info``: usually ``None``, unless it's a playlist with
           `I-Frames`_, in this case it's also a namedtuple ``IFrameStreamInfo``
           with all the attribute available to `#EXT-X-I-FRAME-STREAM-INF`_
        -  ``alternative_audios``: its an empty list, unless it's a playlist
           with `Alternative audio`_, in this case it's a list with ``Media``
           objects with all the attributes available to `#X-EXT-MEDIA`_
        -  ``alternative_videos``: same as ``alternative_audios``
        
        Running Tests
        =============
        
        ::
        
            $ ./runtests
        
        Contributing
        ============
        
        All contribution is welcome, but we will merge a pull request if, and only if, it
        
        -  has tests
        -  follows the code conventions
        
        If you plan to implement a new feature or something that will take more
        than a few minutes, please open an issue to make sure we don't work on
        the same thing.
