        le Web framework.
        
        Uiro provides a foundation to create a pluggable Web application.
        it suggest to use these packages to create third party apps (on uiro 0.1):
        
        * webob==1.2.3
        * gearbox==0.0.2
        * matcha==0.3
        * mako==0.9.0
        * SQLAlchemy==0.8.2
        
        To use these packages, Uiro (and it's third party app) users can
        be free by version collisions.
        
        .. warning::
        
          Uiro 0.1 is still Pre-alpha, not for production usage.
        
        Installing
        ------------
        Create your python env and install it from PyPI::
        
            pip install uiro
        
        First project
        ----------------
        After installing Uiro, 'gearbox' command will be available on your env.
        You can manage projects and applications by using this command.
        Now let's create your first Uiro package::
        
            gearbox create -n packagename
        
        Above 'packagename' string should be replaced to some another name you want.
        
        And then install created package::
        
           cd packagename
           python setup.py develop
        
        This action makes your created package available on your env.
        
        Then create SQLite DB as a file named 'default.db' to current dir::
        
            gearbox initdb
        
        The setting for DB is written in development.ini, and some another
        setting too, check it out.
        
        Finally, you can serve your application, by `serve` command::
        
            gearbox serve
        
        Then, you can run your web browser and access to localhost with port 8888
        to confirm automatically created package is running.
