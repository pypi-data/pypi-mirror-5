        Work in progress.
        
        This software uses RedditImageGrab by Daniel Brown, which can be found at
        http://github.com/dpbrown/RedditImageGrab.
        
        original "readme.txt" of RedditImageGrab:
        
        I created this script to download the latest (and greatest) wallpapers
        off of image subreddits like wallpaper to keep my desktop wallpaper
        fresh and interesting. The main idea is that the script would download
        any JPEG or PNG formatted image that it found listed in the specified
        subreddit and download them to a folder.
        
        An example of running this script to download images with a score
        greater than 50 from the wallpaper sub-reddit into a folder called
        wallpaper would be as follows:
        
            python redditdownload.py wallpaper wallpaper -score 50
        
        And to run the same query but only get new images you don't already
        have, run the following:
        
            python redditdownload.py wallpaper wallpaper -score 50 -update
        
        Advanced Examples:
        
        Retrieve last 10 pics in the 'wallpaper' subreddit with the word
        "sunset" in the title (note: case is ignored by (?i) predicate)
        
            python redditdownload.py wallpaper sunsets -regex '(?i).*sunset.*' -num 10
