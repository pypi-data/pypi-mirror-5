Description: beantop
        =======
        
        Top command for [beanstalkd][]
        
        [beanstalkd]: http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/
        
        =======
        Usage: ./beantop.py -h <host> -p <port>
        
        Inspired in very useful command tools like htop and innotop, I decided a good top command for beanstalkd could be very useful. Right now, it only shows a subset of the information available at a specified interval.
