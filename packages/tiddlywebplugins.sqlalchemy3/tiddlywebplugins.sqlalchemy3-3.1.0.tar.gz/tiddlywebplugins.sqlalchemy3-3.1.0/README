tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy3
============================
_A store for [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com) that uses [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org)._

Any database system supported by sqlalchemy should be usable.

Beyond storing recipes, bags, tiddlers and users, this store also:

* Provides a robust search system that translates structured queries
  to reasonable SQL, allowing fast searches for tiddlers by attributes
  and fields.
* Provides an `index_query` method that allows the store to be used as
  an `indexer` optimizing `select` filters.

See
[tiddlywebplugins.mysql3](https://github.com/cdent/tiddlywebplugins.mysql)
for a derivative optimized for MySQL.

See <http://tiddlyweb-sql.tiddlyspace.com/> for additional documentation and
assistance.
