INTRODUCTION

dkimpy is a library that implements DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) email
signing and verification.

VERSION

This is dkimpy 0.5.4.

REQUIREMENTS

 - Python 2.x >= 2.6, or Python 3.x >= 3.1.
 - dnspython or pydns. dnspython is preferred if both are present.

INSTALLATION

To build and install dkimpy:

    python setup.py install

TESTING

To run dkimpy's test suite:

    PYTHONPATH=. python dkim
or
    python test.py
or
    PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest dkim.tests.test_suite

Alternatively, if you have testrepository installed:

    testr init
    testr run

USAGE

The dkimpy library offers one module called dkim. The sign() function takes an
RFC822 formatted message, along with some signing options, and returns a
DKIM-Signature header line that can be prepended to the message. The verify()
function takes an RFC822 formatted message, and returns True or False depending
on whether the signature verifies correctly.

Two helper programs are also supplied: dkimsign.py and dkimverify.py.

dkimsign.py is a filter that reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and
writes the same message on standard output with a DKIM-Signature line
prepended. The signing options are specified on the command line:

dkimsign.py selector domain privatekeyfile [identity]

The identity is optional and defaults to "@domain".

dkimverify.py reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and returns with exit
code 0 if the signature verifies successfully. Otherwise, it returns with exit
code 1. 

FEEDBACK

Bug reports may be submitted to the bug tracker for the dkimpy project on
launchpad.
