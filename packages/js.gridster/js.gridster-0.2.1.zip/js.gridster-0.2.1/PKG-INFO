        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `gridster`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.gridster``) are published to some URL.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`gridster`: https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``gridster`` from ``js.gridster``
        and ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.gridster import gridster
          >>> gridster.need()
