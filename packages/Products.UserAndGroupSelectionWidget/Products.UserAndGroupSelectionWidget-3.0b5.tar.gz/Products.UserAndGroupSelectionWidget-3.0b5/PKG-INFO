Description: ===========================
        UserAndGroupSelectionWidget
        ===========================
        
        -------
        Purpose
        -------
        
        UserAndGroupSelectionWidget is a widget to search and select users
        and/or groups from a huge base of users. It uses a modernized, fast code-base
        and is tested with hundreds of groups and thousands of users.
        
        It is configurable to select only groups, only users, both or only user of a 
        distinct group.
        
        Widgets for both Archetypes and z3c.form are available.
        
        ------------
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        * bda.cache
        
        The 3.0beta1 version now additionally depends on:
        
        * lxml
        * plone.dexterity
        
        It's possible to make these dependencies optional, and this should perhaps be done
        before the final 3.0 release.
