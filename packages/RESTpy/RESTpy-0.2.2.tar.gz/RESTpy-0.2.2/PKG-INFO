        ======
        
        **Werkzeug extensions for building RESTful services.**
        
        What is RESTpy?
        ===============
        
        RESTpy is a small set of additions and extensions to werkzeug that make it
        a little easier to roll out a RESTful web service.
        
        Example Usage
        =============
        
        ::
        
            from restpy.applications import RestApplication
            from restpy.wsgi import RequestMiddleware
        
            from werkzeug.routing import Map, Rule
            from werkzeug.wrappers import Response
        
        
            class IndexEndpoint(object):
        
                def GET(self, request):
                    return Response("GET")
        
                def POST(self, request):
                    return Response("POST")
        
                def PUT(self, request):
                    return Response("PUT")
        
                def DELETE(self, request):
                    return Response("DELETE")
        
            urls = Map([Rule("/", endpoint=IndexEndpoint)])
        
            application = RequestMiddleware(RestApplication(urls))
        
        This package also comes with a helper script that can generate RESTful web
        service projects or individual service handlers using boilerplate code::
        
            $ restpy project MySocialNetwork
            $ cd myproject
            $ restpy service person
            $ restpy service friend --models
