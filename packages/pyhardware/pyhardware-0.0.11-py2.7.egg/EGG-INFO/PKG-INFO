Description: =============================================
        pyhardware: data acquisition hub
        =============================================
        
        **pyhardware** combines in one package several data-acquisition protocols:
          - ivi drivers (using the lower level package pyivi)
          - visa
          - serial
        
        Each instrument connected to the machine can be autodetected, and assigned a unique logical name.
        Graphical tools are provided to configure the different instruments and the way they should 
        be interfaced.
        
        It uses the lower-level package pyivi to communicate with ivi-drivers on the machine. The specificity of this package
        is to directly interact with the ivi-framework using comtypes and ctypes. This makes fully use of the interchangeability feature of IVI instruments:
        new instruments can be installed in a single click by simply installing the IVI-drivers provided by the manufacturer.
        
        pyhardware is part of a higher-level package : pyinstruments, that you might want to check out : it adds-up database-capabilities to store the curves from the instruments in a consistent way.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Direct dependancies for pyhardware are:
          - PyQt4
          - pyivi <-- (ctypes + comtypes)
        
        The windows installer takes care of installing all the dependencies.
