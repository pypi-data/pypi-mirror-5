Summary:  
source_analyzer is a simple code complexity source_file_counter without caring about the C/C++ header files.
It can deal with C/C++/Objective C & TNSDL code. It count the NLOC (lines of code without comments), CCN 
(cyclomatic complexity number) and token count of _functions.

Description: #Header Free Cyclomatic Complexity Analyzer
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/terryyin/hfcca.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/terryyin/hfcca)
        
        This tool will calculate the cycolomatic complexity of C/C++/Objective C code without caring about header files and preprocessors. So the tool is actually calculating how complex the code 'looks' rather than how complex the code 'is'.
        
        People will need this tool because it's often very hard to get all the include folders and files right with a similar tool, but we don't really need that kind of accuracy when come to cyclomatic complexity.
        <pre>
        Usage: python hfcca.py [options] [PATH or FILE] [PATH] ... 
        
        or: python hfcca.py install
        </pre>
        Than you can run hfcca.py from any where.
        
         hfcca (verion 1.5) is a simple code complexity counter without caring about
        the C/C++ header files. It can deal with C/C++/ObjectiveC & TNSDL code. It count the NLOC
        (lines of code without comments), CCN  (cyclomatic complexity number) and
        token count of functions.
        
        It requires python2.6 or above (early versions are not verified).
        
        To install it on your computer(so that you don't need to do python myPath/hfcca/hfcca.py all the time):
        <pre>
        python hfcca.py install
        Or,
        sudo python hfcca.py install
        </pre>
        Then you can just type hfcca.py from any where in your command line.
        <pre>
        Options:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -v, --verbose         Output in verbose mode (long function name)
          -C CCN, --CCN=CCN     Threshold for cyclomatic complexity number warning.
                                functions with CCN bigger than this number will be
                                shown in warning
          -w, --warnings_only   Show warnings only
          -i NUMBER, --ignore_warnings=NUMBER
                                If the number of warnings is equal or less than the
                                number, the tool will exit normally, otherwize it will
                                generate error. Useful in makefile when improving
                                legacy code.
          -x EXCLUDE, --exclude=EXCLUDE
                                Exclude data files that match this regular expression
          -X, --xml             Generate XML in cppncss style instead of the normal
                                tabular output. Useful to generate report in Hudson
                                server
          -p, --preprocess      Use preprocessor, always ignore the #else branch. By
                                default, source_analyzer just ignore any preprocessor
                                statement.
          -a ARGUMENTS, --arguments=ARGUMENTS
                                Limit for number of parameters
          -P, --no_preprocessor_count
                                By default, a #if will also increase the complexity.
                                Adding this option to ignore them
          -t WORKING_THREADS, --working_threads=WORKING_THREADS
                                number of working threads. The default value is 1.
