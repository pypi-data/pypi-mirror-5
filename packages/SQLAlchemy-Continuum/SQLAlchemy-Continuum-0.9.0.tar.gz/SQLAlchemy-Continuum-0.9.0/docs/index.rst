SQLAlchemy-Continuum
====================

SQLAlchemy-Continuum is a versioning extension for SQLAlchemy.

Why?
----

SQLAlchemy already has versioning extension. This extension however is very limited. It does not support versioning entire transactions.

Hibernate for Java has Envers, which is propably the most advanced database versioning tool out there. Ruby on Rails has papertrail_, which has very nice API but lacks the efficiency and feature set of Envers.

As a Python/SQLAlchemy enthusiast I wanted to create a database versioning tool for Python with all the features of Envers and with as intuitive API as papertrail. Also I wanted to make it _fast_ keeping things as close to the database as possible.


Features
--------

* Does not store updates which don't change anything
* Supports alembic migrations
* Can revert objects data as well as all object relations at given transaction even if the object was deleted
* Transactions can be queried afterwards using SQLAlchemy query syntax
* Query for changed records at given transaction
* History models give access to parent objects relations at given point in time



Installation
------------


::


    pip install SQLAlchemy-Continuum


Basics
------

In order to make your models versioned you need two things:

1. Call make_versioned() before your models are defined.
2. Add __versioned__ to all models you wish to add versioning to


::


    import sqlalchemy as sa
    from sqlalchemy_continuum import make_versioned


    make_versioned()


    class Article(Base):
        __versioned__ = {}
        __tablename__ = 'user'

        id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
        name = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(255))
        content = sa.Column(sa.UnicodeText)


    # after you have defined all your models, call configure_mappers:
    sa.orm.configure_mappers()


After this setup SQLAlchemy-Continuum does the following things:

1. It creates ArticleHistory model that acts as version history for Article model
2. Creates TransactionLog and TransactionChanges models for transactional history tracking
3. Adds couple of listeners so that each Article object insert, update and delete gets recorded


When the models have been configured either by calling configure_mappers() or by accessing some of them the first time, the following __versioned__ attributes become available:


::


    Article.__versioned__['class']
    # ArticleHistory class

    Article.__versioned__['transaction_changes']
    # TransactionChanges class

    Article.__versioned__['transaction_log']
    # TransactionLog class


Versions and transactions
-------------------------

At the end of each transaction SQLAlchemy-Continuum gathers all changes together and creates
version objects for each changed versioned entity. Continuum also creates one TransactionLog entity and
N number of TransactionChanges entities per transaction (here N is the number of affected classes per transaction).
TransactionLog and TransactionChanges entities are created for transaction tracking.


::


    article = Article(name=u'Some article')
    session.add(article)
    session.commit()

    article.versions[0].name == u'Some article'

    article.name = u'Some updated article'

    session.commit()

    article.versions[1].name == u'Some updated article'


History objects
===============


Operation types
---------------

When changing entities and committing results into database Continuum saves the used
operations (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) into version entities. The operation types are stored
by default to a small integer field named 'operation_type'. Class called 'Operation' holds
convenient constants for these values as shown below:

::


    from sqlalchemy_continuum import Operation

    article = Article(name=u'Some article')
    session.add(article)
    session.commit()

    article.versions[0].operation_type == Operation.INSERT

    article.name = u'Some updated article'
    session.commit()
    article.versions[1].operation_type == Operation.UPDATE

    session.delete(article)
    session.commit()
    article.versions[2].operation_type == Operation.DELETE



Version traversal
-----------------

::

    first_version = article.versions[0]
    first_version.index
    # 0


    second_version = first_version.next
    assert second_version == article.versions[1]

    second_version.previous == first_version
    # True

    second_version.index
    # 1


Changeset
---------

Continuum provides easy way for getting the changeset of given version object. Each version contains a changeset
property which holds a dict of changed fields in that version.

::


    article = Article(name=u'New article', content=u'Some content')
    session.add(article)
    session.commit(article)

    version = article.versions[0]
    version.changeset
    # {
    #   'id': [None, 1],
    #   'name': [None, u'New article'],
    #   'content': [None, u'Some content']
    # }
    article.name = u'Updated article'
    session.commit()

    version = article.versions[1]
    version.changeset
    # {
    #   'name': [u'New article', u'Updated article'],
    # }

    session.delete(article)
    version = article.versions[1]
    version.changeset
    # {
    #   'id': [1, None]
    #   'name': [u'Updated article', None],
    #   'content': [u'Some content', None]
    # }


SQLAlchemy-Continuum also provides a utility function called changeset. With this function
you can easily check the changeset of given object in current transaction.



::


    from sqlalchemy_continuum import changeset


    article = Article(name=u'Some article')
    changeset(article)
    # {'name': [u'Some article', None]}




Reverting changes
-----------------

::

    article = Article(name=u'New article', content=u'Some content')
    session.add(article)
    session.commit(article)

    version = article.versions[0]
    article.name = u'Updated article'
    session.commit()

    version.reify()
    session.commit()

    article.name
    # u'New article'


Version relationships
---------------------

Each version object reflects all parent object relationships. You can think version object relations as 'relations of parent object in given point in time'.

Lets say you have two models: Article and Category. Each Article has one Category. In the following example we first add article and category objects into database.

Continuum saves new ArticleHistory and CategoryHistory records in the background. After that we update the created article entity to use another category. Continuum creates new version objects accordingly.

Lastly we check the category relations of different article versions.


::


    category = Category(name=u'Some category')
    article = Article(
        name=u'Some article',
        category=category
    )
    session.add(article)
    session.commit()

    article.category = Category(name=u'Some other category')
    session.commit()


    article.versions[0].category.name = u'Some category'
    article.versions[1].category.name = u'Some other category'


Transactions
============


TransactionLog
--------------


For each committed transaction SQLAlchemy-Continuum creates a new TransactionLog record.

TransactionLog can be queried just like any other sqlalchemy declarative model.

::


    TransactionLog = Article.__versioned__['transaction_class']

    # find all transactions
    session.query(TransactionLog).all()


TransactionMeta
---------------

Each transaction has a relation to TransactionMeta class. This class contains three columns transaction_id, key and value.

You can easily 'tag' transactions with certain key value pairs by giving these keys and values as parameters to tx_meta function of VersioningManager.


::


    from sqlalchemy_continuum import versioning_manager

    article = Article()
    session.add(article)

    with versioning_manager.tx_meta(some_key=u'some value')
        session.commit()


    # find all transactions with 'article' tags
    query = (
        session.query(TransactionLog)
        .filter(TransactionLog.meta['some_key'] == 'some value')
    )


Using lazy values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::


    from sqlalchemy_continuum import versioning_manager

    article = Article()
    session.add(article)

    with versioning_manager.tx_meta(article_id=lambda: article.id)
        session.commit()


    # find all transactions where meta parameter article_id is given article id
    query = (
        session.query(TransactionLog)
        .filter(TransactionLog.meta['article_id'] == article.id)
    )


TransactionChanges
------------------

In order to be able to to fetch efficiently entities that changed in given transaction SQLAlchemy-Continuum keeps track of changed entities in transaction_changes table.

This table has only two fields: transaction_id and entity_name. If for example transaction consisted of saving 5 new User entities and 1 Article entity, two new rows would be inserted into transaction_changes table.

================    =================
transaction_id          entity_name
----------------    -----------------
233678                  User
233678                  Article
================    =================



Find entities that changed in given transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can easily get a dictionary of all changed entities by accessing the changed_entities property of
given transaction. This dictionary contains class objects as keys and entities as values.


::


    tx_log = self.session.query(TransactionLog).first()

    tx_log.changed_entities
    # dict of changed entities



Queries
=======


You can query history models just like any other sqlalchemy declarative model.

::

    ArticleHistory = Article.__versioned__['class']

    session.query(ArticleHistory).filter_by(name=u'some name').all()



Querying for versions of entity that modified given property
------------------------------------------------------------

In the following example we want to find all versions of Article class which changed the attribute 'name'. This example assumes you have set 'track_property_modifications' configuration option as True.

::

    ArticleHistory = Article.__versioned__['class']

    session.query(ArticleHistory).filter(ArticleHistory.name_mod).all()



Configuration
=============

Basic configuration options
---------------------------

Here is a full list of options that can be passed to __versioned__ attribute:

* base_classes (default: None)

* table_name (default: '%s_history')

* revision_column_name (default: 'revision')

* transaction_column_name (default: 'transaction_id')

* operation_type_column_name (default: 'operation_type')

* relation_naming_function (default: lambda a: pluralize(underscore(a)))

* track_property_modifications (default: False)

* modified_flag_suffix (default: '_mod')


Example
::

    class Article(Base):
        __versioned__ = {
            'transaction_column_name': 'tx_id'
        }
        __tablename__ = 'user'

        id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
        name = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(255))
        content = sa.Column(sa.UnicodeText)


Customizing versioned mappers
-----------------------------

By default SQLAlchemy-Continuum versions all mappers. You can override this behaviour by passing the desired mapper class/object to make_versioned function.


::

    make_versioned(mapper=my_mapper)


Customizing versioned sessions
------------------------------


By default SQLAlchemy-Continuum versions all sessions. You can override this behaviour by passing the desired session class/object to make_versioned function.


::

    make_versioned(session=my_session)



Continuum Schema
================

By default SQLAlchemy-Continuum creates a history table for each versioned entity table. The history tables are suffixed with '_history'. So for example if you have two versioned tables 'article' and 'category', SQLAlchemy-Continuum would create two history models 'article_history' and 'category_history'.

The history tables contain these columns:

* id of the original entity (this can be more then one column in the case of composite primary keys)
* transaction_id - an integer. Matches to the id number in the transaction_log table.
* operation_type - a small integer defining the type of the operation
* versioned fields from the original entity

The primary key of each history table is the combination of parent table's primary key + the transaction_id. This means there can be at most one history table entry for a given entity instance at given transaction.

Continuum also generates 3 tables for efficient transaction storage namely transaction_log, transaction_changes and transaction_meta. The generation of transaction_changes and transaction_meta is optional. However it is recommended if transactions need to be queried efficently afterwards.


Alembic migrations
==================

Each time you make changes to database structure you should also change the associated history tables. When you make changes to your models SQLAlchemy-Continuum automatically alters the history model definitions, hence you can use `alembic revision --autogenerate` just like before. You just need to make sure `make_versioned` function gets called before alembic gathers all your models.

Pay close attention when dropping or moving data from parent tables and reflecting these changes to history tables.


Extensions
==========

Flask
-----

    SQLAlchemy-Continuum comes with built-in extension for Flask. This extensions saves current user id as well as user remote address in transaction log.


::

    from sqlalchemy_continuum.ext.flask import FlaskVersioningManager
    from sqlalchemy_continuum import make_versioned


    make_versioned(manager=FlaskVersioningManager())
