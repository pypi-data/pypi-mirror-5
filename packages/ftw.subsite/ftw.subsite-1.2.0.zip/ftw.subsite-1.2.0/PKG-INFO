Description: ftw.subsite
        ===========
        
        ``ftw.subsite`` provides a ``Subsite`` content type for embedding another website
        within a Plone site.
        It does this by defining it as navigation root.
        
        
        Additional functionality provided by ``ftw.subsite``
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        - It is possible to define a language on a subsite content, which overrides the
          default behavior of how Plone deals with languages (PloneLanguageTool).
          If you define a language on a subsite all content on and in the
          subsite will be delivered in the chosen language. This functionality
          is not related to the product LinguaPlone.
        
          Make sure you have all languages activated you want, for example:
        
          .. code:: ini
        
              environment-vars =
                  PTS_LANGUAGES de en fr
                  zope_i18n_allowed_languages de en fr
        
        
        - ``ftw.subsite`` has its own language switch viewlet which is based
          on the Subsite configuration. You can connect two or more subsites with
          different languages together by referencing each other with the custom
          reference field on the Subsite.
        
        - Custom CSS for a Subsite
        
        - Custom Logo for a Subsite. The logo is registered with a different name `subsite.logo`.
          The setup of `ftw.subsite` hides the default plone logo. You can change this afterwards
          if you like.
