        A Nose plugin that allows to run tests continuously (uses watchdog_ for
        listening to filesystem events).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Usual thing:
        
            pip install nose-watch
        
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        In order to use this plugin use the ``--with-watch`` switch::
        
            nosetests --with-watch
        
        You can pass any other options/arguments, tests should be run normally but
        process would stay there and watch for changes on ``*.py`` files. Every change
        should re-run tests.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        We use tox_ for tests. Repository is at https://github.com/lukaszb/nose-watch/.
        We prefer pull requests for sending patches.
        
        To test the package you can simply run::
        
            nosetests
        
        .. note:: Please do not use the plugin itself (--with-watch) to test the plugin
           as it would be picked by nose before the one from repository. If you want to
           watch for changes please use provided ``watch-tests.sh`` script.
