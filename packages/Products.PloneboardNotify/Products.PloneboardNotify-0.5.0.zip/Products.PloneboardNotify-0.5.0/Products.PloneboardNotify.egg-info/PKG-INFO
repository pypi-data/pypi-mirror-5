        Introduction
        ============
        
        Add some configuration to your Plone site for sending e-mail notifications when
        new discussions or replies are added to `Ploneboard`__ forums.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Ploneboard
        
        This product can be useful in a Plone site where you have a lot of forums or forums are
        one of the main content.
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        After installation, go the "*Plone Configuration*" panel and access the new
        "*Ploneboard notification system*" section.

        General settings
        ----------------
        
        When configured, general setting are applied to all forums inside every message board (this
        is also applied to forums outside any message board, a configuration you can manually obtain
        from Ploneboard).
        
        Follow a list of available options
        
        **Send to all?**
            If you check this, a mail will be sent to every user of the site.
        **Recipients**
            A list of recipients. Recipients can be **site members**, **groups** (so an e-mail will
            be sent to users inside those groups) or e-mail address.
            
            For every entry in this list, you can add a ``|bcc`` suffix to **send messages using BCC** to
            one or more user/group/address.
        
        Local configuration for forums
        ------------------------------
        
        From the form above you can quick access any other forum inside the site, from the
        "*Local configuration for forums*" section.
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/Products.PloneboardNotify-0.5.0-02.png
           :alt: Ploneboard notifications section
        
        From there you can apply the same configurations above to a single forum.
        
        The general rule is: "General settings" are applied to any forum, excluded forums where you
        add a local configuration.
        
        Hidden features
        ---------------
        
        Accessing ZMI, you can go to a ``ploneboard_notify_properties`` inside the ``portal_properties``
        tool. **Note**: this mess will probably change in future releases.
        
        ``msg_subject``
            Mail subject. If empty, "*New comment added on the forum:*" plus the forum name will be used.
        ``msg_from``
            Part of the mail message that identify who sent the message.
            If empty "*Message added by:*" plus the user name will be used.
        ``msg_argument``
            Suffix for the forum argument (the main discussion title). If empty, "*Argument is:*" plus
            the title will be used.
        ``msg_mess``
            Introduction to the new comment text. If empty, "*The new message is:*" plus the whole
            comment text will be used.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Provide a way to manipulate the notification message format
        * No more ZMI needs or ``|bcc`` suffix: switch to Plone registry
        * Make the sender configurable globally, for single forum, etc
        * Notification messages to local roles (see `#1`__)
        * Current version support global configuration and forum specific ones; the long-term
          plan wanna reach also forum area configurations
        * A complete, clean uninstall procedure that remove all unwanted stuff
