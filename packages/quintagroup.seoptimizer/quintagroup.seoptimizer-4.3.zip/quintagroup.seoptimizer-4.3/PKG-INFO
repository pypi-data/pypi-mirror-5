Description: Introduction

        Quintagroup Search Engine Optimization Tool (quintagroup.seoptimizer)
        was created to enhance SE visibility of Plone sites.

               :target: https://travis-ci.org/quintagroup/quintagroup.seoptimizer
        
        quintagroup.seoptimizer allows per document editing of:
        
        * HTML Title tag
        * META description tag
        * META keywords tag
        * HTML comment into page header
        * HTML noframes tag into page header
        * META robots tag
        * META Disposition tag
        * Canonical URl http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/qSEOptimizer#CanonicalURL
        
        For Title, description keywords and comment you have statistics (total/stop/used words, field length counter).
        
        IMPORTANT
        ---------
        
        **Starting from 3.0 release - quintagroup.seoptimizer package does not need 'overrides.zcml' file. So please remove 'quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides' line from your buildout's ZCML area.**
          
        Usage
        -----
        
        * Go to Plone Control Panel, enable Plone SEO for desired content types
        
        * Go to a document (Blog entry, news item, event, etc)
        
        * Switch to *SEO Properties* tab
        
        * Select *Override* checkboxes of features you want to override
        
        * Type-in your SEO values
        
        * Save changes
        
        * Do this for all documents that need enhanced SEO properties
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Plone 3.x, Plone 4.x
        
        quintagroup.seoptimizer requires plone.browserlayer package to be installed in your site. plone.browserlayer package is shipped with Plone >= 3.1 and thus you don't need anything extra when you have that version of Plone.
        
        But for Plone 3.0.x < 3.1 the process looks like this:
        
            * if you are creating a new Plone site and want it to support Quintagroup Search Engine Optimization Tool, just select 2 extension profiles Local browser layer support and quintagroup.seoptimizer profile in 'Extension Profiles' when adding a new Plone site;
            * if you want to add quintagroup.seoptimizer to already-existing Plone site, you need to apply Local browser layer support extension profile and then quintagroup.seoptimizer profile. You can do it either in  portal_setup/Import or in portal_quickinstaller by simple installation procedure.
        
        In Plone 3.1 you can simply install quintagroup.seoptimizer profile in portal_quickinstaller without need of prior installation of Local browser layer support (that is not available for installation anyway, since it is a part of core system).
        
        IMPORTANT! For Plone 3.0.x you should use plone.browserlayer 1.0.rc3. Be sure to define the right version of plone.browserlayer in your buildout.cfg. For Plone 3.1.x just use the version you have.
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        * For Plone 4 versions - use Plone SEO 4.0 release and up http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/4.0. In your buildout.cfg file's egg section set product version::
        
           [buildout]
           ....
           eggs =
                ...
                quintagroup.seoptimizer >=4.0
        
        * For Plone 3 versions - use the latest Plone SEO 3.x release http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/3.0.5. In your buildout.cfg file's egg section set product version::
        
           [buildout]
           ....
           eggs =
                ...
                quintagroup.seoptimizer >3.0,<4.0
        
        
        * For Plone 2.x versions - use Plone SEO 1.7.1  release http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/1.7.1

        Installation
        ============
        
        Buildout
        --------
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project:
        
        * Add ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
          For Plone 4.x - in your buildout.cfg file write::
        
           [buildout]
           ....
           eggs =
                ...
                quintagroup.seoptimizer >=4.0
        
        
          For Plone 3 - in your buildout.cfg file write::
        
           [buildout]
           ....
           eggs =
                ...
                quintagroup.seoptimizer >3.0,<4.0
        
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
           [instance]
           ...
           zcml =
               quintagroup.seoptimizer
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
           $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::
        
           $ ./bin/instance restart
        
        
        Install quintagroup.seoptimizer via ZMI portal_setup  -> *Import* tab. Select ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
        
        Uninstallation
        ==============
        
        To uninstall quintagroup.seoptimizer - go to ZMI portal_setup  -> *Import* tab. Select ``quintagroup.seoptimizer uninstall`` profile from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
        
        Package Upgrade / Reinstall
        ===========================
        
        In case you want to upgrate quintagroup.seoptimizer to a newer version in your buildout:
        
        * Remove ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides`` from ``buildout.cfg`` file's ZCML area if it is there (starting from 3.0 release - quintagroup.seoptimizer package does not use overrides.zcml file any longer)
        
        * Upgrade quintagroup.seoptimizer to the newer version using buildout (rerun the buildout to replace old package with a new one in your instance)
        
        * Run the reinstall procedure: visit "Site Setup" -> "Add-ons" control panel in your Plone site, where you have to press quintagroup.seoptimizer button next to Upgrade. (The same can be done with quickinstaller via ZMI: at /portal_quickinstaller/manage_installProductsForm: check the seoptimizer box and press Reinstall button.) This is an essential step as new version of product introduces new persistent settings and ways to migrate settings/content from old to new version.
