        Python wrapper for SciDB queries
        
        This package is still in active development.  Several pieces are still
        incomplete, most notably the documentation.  This will be remedied in the
        near-term!
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        SciDB-Py requires a working [SciDB]() installation, as well as a
        [Shim]() network interface connected to the instance.  It requires
        Python 2.6-2.7, and depends on 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        To install the latest release, use
        ```
        pip install scidb-py
        ```
        
        to install from source, type
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Depending on how your Python installation is set up, you
        may need root priviledges for this.
