Description: This script allows you to download images from Picasa and optionally delete
        them.
        
        Usage:
        
            $ picasa_fetcher --username=<username> --password=<password> images/
        
        This will download all images for the given user into the images/ folder (which
        you must create).
        
        This will leave images on the server. To delete images older than N days, do:
        
            $ picasa_fetcher --username=<username> --password=<password> --delete 1 images/
        
        By default, the script will stop as soon as it finds an image with a timestamp
        it has seen before (it fetches images in reverse date order). To keep going,
        potentially overriding local files, use the ``--force`` parameter.
        
        To limit the number of downloads, use the ``--limit`` parameter.
        
        To get more usage information:
        
            $ picasa_fetcher --help
