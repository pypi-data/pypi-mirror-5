About
------
PyMTP is a Pythonic wrapper around libmtp, allowing python applications to 
communicate with MTP devices, such as the Microsoft(R) Zune(TM), Creative(R)
Zen(TM) devices (except the Creative Zen Stone), and many others. 

Why
----
I decided to write pymtp after I got my Creative(R) Zen V Plus, and I noticed
there wasn't any libraries to use MTP in python. I grabbed ctypes and went to 
work. 

Requirements
------------
PyMTP 0.0.4 requires:
	* Python
	* Ctypes (or Python 2.5, as it includes Ctypes)
	* LibMTP 0.2.6 or above

Installing
-----------
To install PyMTP on most systems, run setup.py:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install
	
After running those commands (on *nix, you'll need to run the install command 
as root), PyMTP should be installed and ready to go

Generating documentation
------------------------
While PyMTP doesn't come with any documentation with it, you can generate 
documentation using epydoc. Epydoc makes very pretty documentation:

	epydoc -o <output directory> pymtp.py
	
This, of course, requires epydoc to be installed.

Getting help
-------------
If you find you need help getting PyMTP working, or have any questions or 
comments on PyMTP, please send me a message. I'm usually available on 
irc.freenode.net as "nick125", or email me at nick@nick125.com

Thanks
------
I would like to take this moment to thank everyone who has ever filed a bug
report or a patch. You guys have made me feel like my work is actually 
important to someone and have given me the encouragement to keep working on it.
I'd like to give a special thanks to Dan O'Reilly for his patches and other
contributions to this project.
