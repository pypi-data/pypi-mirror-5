Instantly deploy static HTML sites to S3 at the command line.

I created this out of frustration, after spending a lot of effort trying to
find a PyPI package that did this without problems.

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is at http://alotofeffort.rtfd.org.

Quickstart
----------

Install it::

    pip install alotofeffort
    
Configure Boto the standard way in `~/.boto`::

    [Credentials]
    aws_access_key_id = ...
    aws_secret_access_key = ...

Then use it to deploy a static HTML website to an S3 bucket::

	$ alotofeffort www/ mybucket

Features
--------

* Uses standard Boto configuration.
* Prints the S3 endpoint URL after deploying.
* Auto-configures the bucket to be a website, with all files public.
* Only files that have changed get uploaded. Files are checked for changes by
  comparing the local and remote MD5 hashes of the files.
