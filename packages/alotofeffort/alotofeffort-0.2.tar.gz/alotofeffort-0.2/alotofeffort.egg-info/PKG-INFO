Description: =============================
        A Lot of Effort
        =============================
        
        Instantly deploy static HTML sites to S3 at the command line.
        
        I created this out of frustration, after spending a lot of effort trying to
        find a PyPI package that did this without problems.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The full documentation is at http://alotofeffort.rtfd.org.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Install it::
        
            pip install alotofeffort
            
        Configure Boto the standard way in `~/.boto`::
        
            [Credentials]
            aws_access_key_id = ...
            aws_secret_access_key = ...
        
        Then use it to deploy a static HTML website to an S3 bucket::
        
        	$ alotofeffort www/ mybucket
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Uses standard Boto configuration.
        * Prints the S3 endpoint URL after deploying.
        * Auto-configures the bucket to be a website, with all files public.
