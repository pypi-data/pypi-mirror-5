Description: ===========================
               nose-timelimit
        ===========================
        
        `nose-timelimit` is a nose plugin that allows you automatically skip slow tests.
        
        It requires at least one run with the whole suite to register the timings. If a test fails timings 
        are not registered for it (thus it will never get skipped).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just run ``pip install nose-timelimit`` or ``easy_install nose-timelimit``.
        
        Options
        =======
        
        * ``--with-timelimit`` - Just activates the plugin (will only register timing data).
        * ``--timelimit=X`` - Runs only the tests that had previously ran under ``X`` seconds. Implies ``--with-timelimit``.
        * ``--timelimit-silent`` - Don't print the duration for each test.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Known to work with ``nose 1.3``, it may work with nose as old as ``0.10`` - try it.
