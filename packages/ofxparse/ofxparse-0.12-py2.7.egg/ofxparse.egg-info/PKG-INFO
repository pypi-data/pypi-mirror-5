Description: ofxparse
        ========
        
        ofxparse is a parser for Open Financial Exchange (.ofx) format files.  OFX files
        are available from almost any online banking site, so they work well if you 
        want to pull together your finances from multiple sources.  Online trading accounts
        also provide account statements in OFX files.
        
        There are three different types of OFX files.  This library has been tested with
        BankAccount files.  The other two types, CreditAccount and InvestmentAccount have
        not been tested.  If you have a sample of these other types that could be used to
        help this project, please see the Help! section below.
        
        Example Usage
        =============
        
        Here's a sample program::
        
          from ofxparse import OfxParser
        
          ofx = OfxParser.parse(file('file.ofx'))
          ofx.account                         # An account with information
          ofx.account.number                  # The account number
          ofx.account.routing_number          # The transit id (sometimes called branch number)
          ofx.account.statement               # Account information for a period of time
          ofx.account.statement.start_date    # The start date of the transactions
          ofx.account.statement.end_date      # The end date of the transactions
          ofx.account.statement.transactions  # A list of account activities
          ofx.account.statement.balance       # The money in the account as of the statement date
          ofx.account.statement.available_balance # The money available from the account as of the statement date

        =====
        
        I'm looking for different types of accounts to make this library more robust.  I'm looking for sample
        credit account or investment account files.  Please (anonymize first) and mail to jseutter dot ofxparse
        at gmail dot com.

        =======
        
        ofxparse is released under an MIT license.  See the LICENSE file for the actual 
        license text.  The basic idea is that if you can use Python to do what you are
        doing, you can also use this library.
