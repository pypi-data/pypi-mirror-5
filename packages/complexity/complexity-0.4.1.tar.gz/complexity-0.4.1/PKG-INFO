        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Try it out::
        
            $ pip install complexity
            $ git clone git@github.com:audreyr/complexity-example.git my_proj
            $ cd my_proj
            $ complexity project/ www/
        
        Once you've done that, open a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:9090 to see the newly generated Complexity static site.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Works on Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3.
        * Takes simple HTML templates as input.
        * Template inheritance, filters, etc. (Brought to you by Jinja2.)
        * Data from .json files turns into template context data.
        
        Best Used With
        --------------
        
        Complexity is designed to be used with these packages:
        
        * `Simplicity`_: Converts ReStructuredText into JSON, which Complexity can use
          as input.
        * `A Lot of Effort`_: Deploys a static website (e.g. the output of Complexity)
          to Amazon S3.
        * `Cookiecutter`_: Creates projects from project templates.
        
        Sure, they could have all been built into Complexity, but decoupling them
        seemed like a nice thing to do.

        History
        -------
        
        0.4.1 (2013-07-19)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fix reading of JSON files from `json/`.
        
        0.4 (2013-07-19)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Project layout is now::
        
            my_repo/
            ├── project/       <--------- input
            │   ├── assets/
            │   │   ├── css/
            │   │   ├── js/
            │   │   └── img/
            │   ├── json/
            │   │   └── stuff.json
            │   └── templates/
            │       ├── base.html
            │       ├── index.html
            │       └── about.html
            └── www/          <---------- output (generated)
                ├── index.html
                ├── about/
                │   └── index.html
                ├── css/
                ├── js/
                └── img/
        
        * Assets are copied over to `www/` during site generation.
        * If the `www/` directory was previously created, it prompts the user and then
          deletes it before site regeneration.
        * Templates starting with `base` are not generated as individual pages. They
          are meant to be extended in other templates.

        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Graceful shutdown/restart of dev server.
