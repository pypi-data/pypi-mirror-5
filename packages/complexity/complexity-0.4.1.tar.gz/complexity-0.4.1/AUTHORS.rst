Special Thanks

* Daniel Greenfeld (`@pydanny`_) has done a lot to help get Complexity to
  where it is now. He even came up with the name "Complexity".
* The Complexity Sphinx theme is a heavily customized version of 
  `Kenneth Reitz's Requests theme`_, which itself is a modified version of
  `Armin Ronacher's Flasky theme`_.
