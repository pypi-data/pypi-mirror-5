        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The full documentation is at http://complexity.rtfd.org.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Using Complexity is easy! Try it out::
        
            $ pip install complexity
            $ git clone git@github.com:audreyr/complexity-example.git my_project
            $ cd my_project
            $ complexity
        
        Open a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:9090 to see your newly generated Complexity static site.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Takes simple HTML templates as input.
        * Template inheritance, filters, etc. (Brought to you by Jinja2.)
        * Data from .json files turns into template context data.
        
        Best Used With
        --------------
        
        Complexity is designed to be used with these packages:
        
        * `Simplicity`: Converts ReStructuredText into JSON, which Complexity can use
          as input.
        * `A Lot of Effort`: Deploys a static website (e.g. the output of Complexity)
          to Amazon S3.
        * `Cookiecutter`: Creates projects from project templates.
        
        Sure, they could have all been built into Complexity, but decoupling them
        seemed like a nice thing to do.
