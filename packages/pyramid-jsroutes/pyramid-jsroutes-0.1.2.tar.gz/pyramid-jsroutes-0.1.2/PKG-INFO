Description: Pyramid JSRoutes
        ================
        
        A pyramid routes composer for javascript.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            pip install -U pyramid-jsroutes
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Include the package in your Pyramid app's main function:
        
        ```python
        def main():
            ...
            config.include('jsroutes')
            ...
            return config.make_wsgi_app()
        ```
        
        this will make `jsroutes` available to all your template context, then you can use it like:
        
            <script type="text/javascript">${jsroutes|n}</script>
        
        then you can start composing your Pyramid routes from javascript like:
        
        ```javascript
        JSROUTES.blog_post(1)  // /posts/1
        ```
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        By default it'll only collect the routes once and store it in the registry but you can force reloading everytime for development by settings the following settings:
        
            jsroutes.reload_routes = true
        
        Note
        ----
        
        Each time your modify your Pyramid routes, you need to refresh your page to refetch the updated routes.
