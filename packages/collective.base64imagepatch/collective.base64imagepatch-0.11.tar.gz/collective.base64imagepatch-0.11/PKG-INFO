        collective.base64imagepatch Installation
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        There are two soft dependencies on the underlaying Content-Types-Frameworks of 
        Plone. 
        * Archetypes
        * Dexterity
        None of those must be included seperatly in the buildout, as they are already 
        part of Plone.
        
        
        Installation via zc.buildout
        ----------------------------
        If you are using zc.buildout to manage your Zope/Plone Instances, you can do 
        this:
        
        * Add ``collective.base64imagepatch`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.base64imagepatch
                ...
              
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        The patch is installed and works directly on next startup.
        
        Note: The patch will not show up in any install listing.
        
        To run patch on existing content call patch_all view on any Plone object for 
        just this Plone Site Instance or any Zope Root Object for all Plone Sites. 
        cmf.ManagePortal Permissions required.
