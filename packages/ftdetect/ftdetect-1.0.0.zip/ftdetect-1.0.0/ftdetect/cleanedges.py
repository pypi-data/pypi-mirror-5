    """
    Rounds edge normal vector direction angles to one of four allowed
    values: 0, 45, 90 or 135 degrees, indicating that normal vector
    points horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with either positive or
    negative slope.  Input values which lie within +/- 22.5 degrees of
    an antipode (180, 225, 270, 315, -180, -135, -90, -45) are corrected
    by +/- 180 degrees as necessary.

    Parameters
    ----------

    edgedir: ndarray

        2D array containing estimated edge normal direction vector (e.g.,
        from a grayscale brightness gradient or similar) for each pixel
        in a 2D image.

    Erodes "thick edge" raw edge detection response by deleting those
    responses from pixels which are not at a local maximum relative to
    the two neighbors to either side of them along the edge normal
    direction.

    Parameters
    ----------

    inedge: ndarray

        2D array containing raw edge response from an edge detection
        algorithm.  Larger values are presumed to correspond to sharper,
        more distinct edges (e.g., bright areas immediately adjacent to
        dark, or vice versa).

    rounddir: ndarray (must be same size/shape as inedge)

        2D array of edge normal vector angles rounded to either 0, 45,
        90 or 135 degrees (or equivalent in radians), output by
        roundAngle() function.

def hystThresh(inedge, tlo=0.1, thi=0.3):

    """
    Performs Canny style "hysteresis" or dual-valued response
    thresholding for edge detection algorithms.  Pixels with edge
    responses that fall above the upper threshold (call them "group A"
    for brevity) are automatically included in the output, while pixels
    that fall below the lower threshold ("group C") are automatically
    excluded.  Pixels whose edge response falls between the two
    thresholds ("group B") will be upgraded to the group A list if they
    lie either within an 8 pixel surrounding neighborhood of a pixel
    that was already in group A from the start, or alternatively, if
    they lie within an 8 pixel neighborhood of another group B pixel
    that had previously been upgraded to group A.

    Parameters
    ----------

    inedge: ndarray

        2D array of "thin" edges, e.g. as returned by nonMaxSuppEdge().

    tlo: scalar, optional

        Lower threshold value, as a fraction of maximum edge response
        (must be chosen between 0 and 1, and less than or equal to thi).
        Defaults to 0.1.

    thi: scalar, optional

        Upper threshold value, as a fraction of maximum edge response

def listEdge(edge):
    
    """
    Given a 2D array of edge detection responses, groups edge pixels
    which are "geometrically connected" to one another (i.e., adjacent
    to other pixels that also have a non-zero edge detector response)
    together into discrete clusters.  Outputs a list providing
    membership of each cluster (i.e., the positional indices of
    constituent pixels) as well as the total number of pixels in each
    cluster.

    vidx, hidx: ndarray

        Pair of 2D ragged-end arrays giving pixel membership within each
        edge cluster.  First axis loops over clusters and second index
        loops over individual pixel membership within each cluster; e.g.,
        (vidx[ii][ij], hidx[ii][ij]) will give the indices into the input
        edge array of the ij'th pixel within the ii'th cluster; i.e.
        edge[vidx[ii][ij]][hidx[ii][ij]].  Since each cluster is, in
