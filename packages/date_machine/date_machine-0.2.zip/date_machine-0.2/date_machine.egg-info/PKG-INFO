Description: Date Machine is a Date parsing system.
        
        It is based on Reparse_, and includes 14 date patterns, and a Javascript version.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
              date_machine_parse('All day Thursday-Sunday, Sept. 20-23., Friday September 21')
              #       [Date(month=9, day=20),
              #        Date(month=9, day=21),
              #        Date(month=9, day=22),
              #        Date(month=9, day=23)],
        
        - Fast
        - Scannable: Use over full text and find dates
        - Honest: no approximations given about the dates (if the year is missing, it's not included, for example)
        - Portable: Parser description compiles to Regex/Json. You just have to write the output builder functions.
        - Highly-Customizable: Adding more formats at different levels is easy (if you know regular expressions).
