Date Machine is a Date parsing system.

It is based on Reparse_, and includes 14 date patterns, and a Javascript version.

.. code-block:: python

      date_machine_parse('All day Thursday-Sunday, Sept. 20-23., Friday September 21')
      #       [Date(month=9, day=20),
      #        Date(month=9, day=21),
      #        Date(month=9, day=22),
      #        Date(month=9, day=23)],

- Fast
- Scannable: Use over full text and find dates
- Honest: no approximations given about the dates (if the year is missing, it's not included, for example)
- Portable: Parser description compiles to Regex/Json. You just have to write the output builder functions.
- Highly-Customizable: Adding more formats at different levels is easy (if you know regular expressions).

Installation
------------

    pip install date_machine
    
or

    python setup.py install

in the base directory.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import date_machine
    date_machine.parse('Jan 1st')
    # [Date(month=1, day=11)]
