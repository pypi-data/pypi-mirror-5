Description: 
        TiddlyWeb tool establishing package based hosting of Jinja2
        templates in the tiddlywebplugins package space.
        
        The templates are overridable with local templates in the
        TiddlyWeb instance.
        
        The tool provides a get_template method which takes a template
        name or path. First the tiddlyweb.config['plugin_local_templates']
        directory (defaulting to 'templates') is searched. Then the
        tiddlywebplugins.templates package space is searched (looking
        for the template as a pkg_resource).
        
        This searching may not work for all packaging systems. This has
        been tested with pip.
