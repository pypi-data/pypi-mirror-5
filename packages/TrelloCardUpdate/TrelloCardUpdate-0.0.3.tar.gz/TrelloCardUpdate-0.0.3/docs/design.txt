Trello Note command line tool design

packaged nicely

tu extension cords -m "I priced them on Amazon vs down the streed - I think the extra 2 days we'll have them (we need them now) is worth it" -d

allow any number of args for -m and card name, so these doesn't need quotes
awesome tab completion on card name
if card name not specified, get it in custom prompt

Maybe have a command line interface so it closes nicely, so tab completion doesn't spew all over your bash session

-use editor or -m for message
  figure out what editor to use with VISUAL or EDITOR
  maybe read .gitconfig options for people who don't set VISUAL or EDITOR
-flag for 'move to bottom of list', because that can means it's been dealt with
-pretty print of trello cards and date they've been edited, ideally including ability to view comments
-list all cards you're subcribed to
-list all cards

locally store cached names of cards with ids for quick file completion

nice display of information in description of card, possibly with links
