Description: =============
        Basket Client
        =============
        
        This is a client for Mozilla's email subscription service,
        basket_. Basket is not a real subscription service, but it talks to a
        real one and we don't really care who/what it is.
        
        There are four API methods: subscribe, unsubscribe, user, and
        update_user. View the basket documentation_ for details.

        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install basket-client
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Do you want to subscribe people to Mozilla's newsletters?
        All you need to do is:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import basket
        
            basket.subscribe('<email>', '<newsletter>', <kwargs>)
        
        You can pass additional fields as keyword arguments, such as format
        and country. For a list of available fields and newsletters, see the
        basket documentation_.
        
        .. _documentation: https://github.com/mozilla/basket/#readme
        
        Are you checking to see if a user was successfully subscribed? You can
        use the ``lookup_user`` method like so:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import basket
        
            basket.lookup_user(email='<email>', api_key='<api_key>')
        
        And it will return full details about the user. <api_key> is a special
        token that grants you admin access to the data. Check with `the mozilla.org
        developers`_ to get it.

        Settings
        ========
        
        BASKET_URL
          | URL to basket server, e.g. ``https://basket.mozilla.org``
          | Default: ``http://localhost:8000``
        
        BASKET_API_KEY
          The API Key granted to you by `the mozilla.org developers`_ so that you can
          use the ``lookup_user`` method with an email address.
        
        BASKET_TIMEOUT
          | The number of seconds basket client should wait before giving up on the request.
          | Default: ``10``
        
        If you're using Django_ you can simply add these settings to your
        ``settings.py`` file. Otherwise basket-client will look for these
        values in an environment variable of the same name.
