Description: =============
        Basket Client
        =============
        
        This is a client for Mozilla's email subscription service,
        basket_. Basket is not a real subscription service, but it talks to a
        real one and we don't really care who/what it is.
        
        There are four API methods: subscribe, unsubscribe, user, and
        update_user. View the basket documentation_ for details.

        Usage
        =====
        
        Are you looking to integrate this on a site for email subscriptions?
        All you need to do is:
        
            import basket
        
            basket.subscribe('<email>', '<newsletter>', <kwargs>)
        
        You can pass additional fields as keyword arguments, such as format
        and country. For a list of available fields and newsletters, see the
        basket documentation_.
        
        .. _documentation: https://github.com/mozilla/basket/tree/master/apps/news#readme
        
        Are you checking to see if a user was successfully subscribed? You can
        use the `debug-user` method like so:
        
            import basket
        
            basket.debug_user('<email>', '<supertoken>')
        
        And it return full details about the user. <supertoken> is a special
        token that grants you admin access to the data. Check with `the mozilla.org
        developers`_ to get it.

        Settings
        ========
        
        BASKET_URL
          URL to basket server, e.g. `https://basket.mozilla.com`
        
        If you're using Django_ you can simply add this setting to your
        `settings.py` file. Otherwise basket-client will look for this
        value in a `BASKET_URL` environment variable. The default is
        `http://localhost:8000`.
