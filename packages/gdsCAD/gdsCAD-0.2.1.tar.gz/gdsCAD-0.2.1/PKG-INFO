        gdsCAD -- Simple GDSII design in Python
        ***************************************
        
        gdsCAD is a simple, but powerful, Python package for creating, reading, and
        manipulating GDSII layout files. It's suitable for scripting and interactive
        use. It excels particularly in generating designs with multiple incrementally
        adjusted objects. gdsCAD uses matplotlib to visualize everything from individual
        geometry primitives to the entire layout.
