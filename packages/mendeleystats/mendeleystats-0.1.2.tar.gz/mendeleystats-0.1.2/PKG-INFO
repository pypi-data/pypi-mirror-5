Description: Mendeley Stats
        ==============
        
        A command line tool to extract information about papers in a Mendeley folder.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### OS X and Linux:
        
        ```
        pip install mendeleystats
        ```
        
        Also, you need to set API keys to a configuration file. First, enter http://dev.mendeley.com/ and register an app.
        to access the values of Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. With this information in hands, create a
        file .mendeleystatsconfig in your home directory. The content of this file must follow the format:
        
        ```
        {
            "api_key" : "the value of the consumer key",
            "api_secret" : "the value of the consumer secret"
        }
        ```
        
        ### Windows
        
        I do not know. I accept help to write this :)
        
        
        ## How to use
        
        It is super simple to use:
        
        ```
        mendeleystats [-h] --info {year,type,authors,keywords,publishedin}
                        --output {chart,csv} --folder FOLDER
        ```
        
        For example:
        
        ```
        mendeleystats --info year --output chart --folder datamining
        ```
        
        It displays a chart with information about papers per year from the "datamining" folder.
        You can get other types of information, you only need to change the value of the argument --info,
        the options are: year, type, authors, keywords, and publishedin.
        
        Besides, you can choose to save a .csv file with the information instead get a chart.
        For this, you need to use the value csv in the argument --output.
