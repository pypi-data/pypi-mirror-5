Description: Super Zippy
        ===========
        
        Super Zippy will take a Python package and create a single executable file out of it that you can distribute to all your Linux user friends.
        
        ```bash
        $ echo "entry_point = 'superzippy.packaging:run'" > superconfig.py
        $ superzippy superzippy
        ```
        
        And now we have a single file containing all of Super Zippy's dependencies and code. No installation necessary.
