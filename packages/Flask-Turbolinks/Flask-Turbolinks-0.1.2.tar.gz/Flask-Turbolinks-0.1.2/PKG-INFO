        Turbolinks for Flask.
        
        
        Turbolinks
        ----------
        
        Turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. For more
        information, visit the original rails repo: `turbolinks.js`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install Flask-Turbolinks, simply::
        
            $ pip install Flask-Turbolinks
        
        Or alternatively if you don't have pip::
        
            $ easy_install Flask-Turbolinks
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To enable turbolinks, you need to put `turbolinks.js`_ in the ``<head>`` of
        your html templates.
        
        
        The backend flask app should be wrapped with turbolinks::
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask_turbolinks import turbolinks
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
            # you app should has a secret key for session
            app.secret_key = 'secret'
        
            turbolinks(app)
        
        And everything works now, no more configuration.
        
        .. _`turbolinks.js`: https://github.com/rails/turbolinks
        
        
        Note
        ----
        
        This project does not contain the javascript code, you need to grab the code from `turbolinks.js` on GitHub. It is written in CoffeeScript, you can compile it with::
        
            coffee -c turbolinks.js.coffee
        
        
        Demo
        ----
        
        There is a demo in the ``example`` directory, start a server and open the
        url with Chrome. View the requests with developer tools of Chrome.
