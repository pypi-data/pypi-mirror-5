1.0.1
=====

  * Moved main documentation to Sphinx format in ./docs, and hosted
    the long-form documentation on readthedocs.org. README.rst now
    an abridged version/teaser for the module.

1.0
===

  * Cleaned up source for better PEP8 conformance
  * Bumped version number to 1.0 as part of move to `semantic 
    versioning <http://semver.org>`_, or at least enough of it so
    as to not screw up Python installation procedures (which don't
    seem to understand 0.401 is a lesser version that 0.5, because
    401 > 5).
