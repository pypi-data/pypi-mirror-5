options
=======

``options`` helps encapsulate options and configuration data using a
layered stacking model (a.k.a. nested contexts).

For most functions and many classes, ``options``
is overkill and not recommended.
Python's already-flexible function arguments, ``*args``,
``**kwargs``, and inheritance patterns are elegant and sufficient
for 99.9% of all development situations.

``options``
is intended for the 0.1%: highly
functional classes that have many different options, that
aim for "reasonable" or "intelligent" defaults and
behaviors, that allow users to override those defaults at any time, and yet that
aim for a simple, unobtrusive API.

In those cases, Python's simpler built-in, inheritance-based
model leads to fairly complex code as non-trivial options and argument-management
code spreads through many individual methods. This is where
``options``'s delegation-based approach begins to shine.

Usage
=====

In a typical use, your class defines default option values. Subclasses
can add, remove, or override options. Instances
use class defaults, but they can be overridden when each instance
is created. For any option an instance doesn't override, the class
default "shines through."

So far, this isn't very different from a typical use of Python's
standard instance and
class variables.  The next step is where ``options`` gets interesting.

Individual method calls can similarly override instance and class defaults.
The options stated in each method call obtain
only for the duration of the method's execution.
If the call doesn't set a value, the
instance value applies. If the instance didn't set a
value, its class default applies (and so on, to its superclasses, if any).

One step further, Python's ``with`` statement can be used to
set option values for essentially arbitrary duration. As soon as the
``with`` block exists, the option values automagically fall back to
what they were before the with block. (In general, if any option is unset,
its value falls back to what it was in the next higher layer.)

To recap: Python handles class, subclass, and instance settings.
``options`` handles these as well, but also
adds method and transient settings. By default when Python overrides a setting,
it's destructive; the value cannot be "unset" without additional code.
When a program using ``options`` overrides a setting, it does so non-destructively,
layering the new settings atop the previous ones. When attributes are unset,
they immediately fall back to their prior value (at whatever higher level it
was last set).

Unfortunately, because this is a capability designed for high-end, edge-case
situations, it's hard to demonstrate its virtues with
simple code. But we'll give it a shot.

::

    from options import Options, attrs

    class Shape(object):

        options = Options(
            name   = None,
            color  = 'white',
            height = 10,
            width  = 10,
        )

        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            self.options = Shape.options.push(kwargs)

        def draw(self, **kwargs):
            opts = self.options.push(kwargs)
            print attrs(opts)

    one = Shape(name='one')
    one.draw()
    one.draw(color='red')
    one.draw(color='green', width=22)

yielding::

    color='white', width=10, name='one', height=10
    color='red', width=10, name='one', height=10
    color='green', width=22, name='one', height=10

So far we could do this with instance variables and standard arguments. It
might look a bit like this::

    class ClassicShape(object):

        def __init__(self, name=None, color='white', height=10, width=10):
            self.name   = name
            self.color  = color
            self.height = height
            self.width  = width

but when we got to the ``draw`` method, things would be quite a bit messier.::

        def draw(self, **kwargs):
            name   = kwargs.get('name',   self.name)
            color  = kwargs.get('color',  self.color)
            height = kwargs.get('height', self.height)
            width  = kwargs.get('width',  self.width)
            print "color='{0}', width={1}, name='{2}', height={3}".format(color, width, name, height)

One problem here is that we broke apart the values provided to
``__init__()`` into separate instance variables, now we need to
re-assemble them into something unified.  And we need to explicitly
choose between the ``**kwargs`` and the instance variables.  It
gets repetitive, and is not pretty. Another classic alternative,
using native keyword arguments, is no better::

        def draw2(self, name=None, color=None, height=None, width=None):
            name   = name   or self.name
            color  = color  or self.color
            height = height or self.height
            width  = width  or self.width
            print "color='{0}', width={1}, name='{2}', height={3}".format(color, width, name, height)

If we add just a few more instance variables, we have the `Mr. Creosote
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Creosote>`_ of class design on our hands. Every
possible setting has to be managed in every method. It's neither elegant nor
scalable. Things get even worse if we want to set default values for all shapes in the
class. We have to rework every method that uses values, the ``__init__`` method,
*et cetera*. We've entered "just one more wafer-thin mint..." territory.

But with ``options``, it's easy::

    Shape.options.set(color='blue')
    one.draw()
    one.draw(height=100)
    one.draw(height=44, color='yellow')

yields::

    color='blue', width=10, name='one', height=10
    color='blue', width=10, name='one', height=100
    color='yellow', width=10, name='one', height=44

In one line, we reset the default for all ``Shape`` objects. (In typical usage
we'd also define ``Shape.set()`` to transparently forward
to ``Shape.options.set()`` for an even simpler resulting API.)

The more options and settings a class has, the more unwieldy the class and
instance variable approach becomes, and the more desirable the delegation
alternative. Inheritance is a great software pattern for many kinds of data and
program structures--but it's a bad, or at least incomplete,
pattern for complex option and configuration
handling.

For richly-featured classes, ``options``'s delegation pattern is
simpler. As the number of options grows, almost no additional
code is required. More options
impose no additional complexity and introduce no additional failure modes.
Consolidating
options into one place, and providing
neat attribute-style access, keeps everything
tidy. We can add new options or methods with confidence::

    def is_tall(self, **kwargs):
        opts = self.options.push(kwargs)
        return opts.height > 100

Under the covers, ``options`` uses a variation on the ``ChainMap`` data
structure (a multi-layer dictionary) to provide option stacking. Every
option set is stacked on top of previously set option sets, with lower-level
values shining through if they're not set at higher levels. This stacking or
overlay model resembles how local and global variables are managed in many
programming languages.

This makes advanced use cases, such as temporary value changes, easy::

    with one.settings(height=200, color='purple'):
        one.draw()
        if is_tall(one):
            ...         # it is, but only within the ``with`` context

    if is_tall(one):    # nope, not here!
        ...

Full disclosure: Doing temporary settings took more class setup code
than is shown above. Four lines of code, to be precise.

As one final feature, consider "magical" parameters. Add the following
code::

    options.magic(
        height = lambda v, cur: cur.height + int(v) if isinstance(v, str) else v,
        width  = lambda v, cur: cur.width  + int(v) if isinstance(v, str) else v
    )

Now, in addition to absolute ``height`` and ``width`` parameters specified with
``int`` (integer/numeric) values, your module
auto-magically supports relative parameters for ``height`` and ``width``.::

    one.draw(width='+200')

yields::

    color='blue', width=210, name='one', height=10

Neat, huh?

sprawl"

Design Considerations
=====================

In general, classes will define a set of methods that are "outwards
facing"--methods called by external code when consuming the class's
functionality. Those methods should generally expose their options through
``**kwargs``, creating a local variable (say ``opts``) that represents the sum
of all options in use--the full stack of call, instance, and class options,
including any present magical interpretations.

Internal class methods--the sort that are not generally called by external code,
and that by Python convention are often prefixed by an underscore (``_``)--these
generally do not need ``**kwargs``. They should accept their options as a
single variable (say ``opts`` again) that the externally-facing methods will
provide.

For example, if ``options`` didn't provide the nice formatting function ``attrs``,
we might have designed our own::

    def _attrs(self, opts):
        nicekeys = [ k for k in opts.keys() if not k.startswith('_') ]
        return ', '.join([ "{}={}".format(k, repr(opts[k])) for k in nicekeys ])

    def draw(self, **kwargs):
        opts = self.options.push(kwargs)
        print self._attrs(opts)

``draw()``, being the outward-facing API, accepts general arguments and
manages their stacking (by ``push``ing ``kwargs`` onto the instance options).
When the internal ``_attrs()`` method is called, it is handed a pre-digested
``opts`` package of options.

A nice side-effect of making this distinction: Whenever you see a method with
``**kwargs``, you know it's outward-facing. When you see a method with just
``opts``, you know it's internal.

Objects defined with ``options`` make excellent "callables."
Define the ``__call__`` method, and you have a very nice analog of
function calls.

``options`` has broad utility, but it's not for every class or module. It best
suits high-level front-end APIs that multiplex lots of potential functionality,
and wish/need to do it in a clean/simple way. Classes for which the set of
instance variables is small, or functions/methods for which the set of
known/possible parameters is limited--these work just fine with classic Python
calling conventions. For those, ``options`` is overkill. "Horses for courses."

Setting and Unsetting
=====================

Using ``options``, objects often become "entry points" that represent both
a set of capabilities and a set of configurations for how that functionality
will be used. As a result, you may want to be able to set the object's
values directly, without referencing their underlying ``options``. It's
convenient to add a ``set()`` method, then use it, as follows::

    def set(self, **kwargs):
        self.options.set(**kwargs)

    one.set(width='*10', color='orange')
    one.draw()

yields::

    color='orange', width=100, name='one', height=10

``one.set()`` is now the equivalent of ``one.options.set()``. Or continue using
the ``options`` attribute explicitly, if you prefer that.

Values can also be unset.::

    from options import Unset

    one.set(color=Unset)
    one.draw()

yields::

    color='blue', width=100, name='one', height=10

Because ``'blue'`` was the color to which ``Shape`` had be most recently set.
With the color of the instance unset, the color of the class shines through.

.. note:: While options are ideally accessed with an attribute notion,
    the preferred of setting options is through method calls: ``set()`` if
    accessing directly, or ``push()`` if stacking values as part of a method call.
    These perform the interpretation and unsetting magic;
    straight assignment does not. In the future, ``options`` may provide an
    equivalent ``__setattr__()`` method to allow assignment--but not yet.

Leftovers
=========

``options`` expects you to define all feasible and legitimate options at the
class level, and to give them reasonable defaults.

None of the initial settings ever have magic applied. Much of the
expected interpretation "magic" will be relative settings, and relative settings
require a baseline value. The top level is expected and demanded to provide a
reasonable baseline.

Any options set "further down" such as when an instance is created or a method
called should set keys that were already-defined at the class level.

However, there are cases where "extra" ``**kwargs`` values may be provided and
make sense. Your object might be a very high level entry point, for example,
representing very large buckets of functionality, with many options. Some of
those options are relevant to the current instance, while others are intended as
pass-throughs for lower-level modules/objects. This may seem a doubly rarefied
case--and it is, relatively speaking. But `it does happen
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/show>`_--and when you need
multi-level processing, it's really, really super amazingly handy to
have it.

``options`` supports this in its core ``push()`` method by taking the values
that are known to be part of the class's options, and deleting those from
``kwargs``. Any values left over in the ``kwargs`` ``dict`` are either errors,
or intended for other recipients.

As yet, there is no automatic check for leftovers.

Magic Parameters
================

Python's ``*args`` variable-number of arguments and ``**kwargs`` keyword
arguments are sometimes called "magic" arguments. ``options`` takes this up a
notch, allowing setters much like Python's ``property`` function or
``@property`` decorator. This allows arguments to be interpreted on the fly.
This is useful, for instance, to provide relative rather than just absolute
values. As an example, say that we added this code after ``Shape.options`` was
defined::

    options.magic(
        height = lambda v, cur: cur.height + int(v) if isinstance(v, str) else v,
        width  = lambda v, cur: cur.width  + int(v) if isinstance(v, str) else v
    )

Now, in addition to absolute ``height`` and ``width`` parameters which are
provided by specifying ``int`` (integer/numeric) values, your module
auto-magically supports relative parameters for ``height`` and ``width``.::

    one.draw(width='+200')

yields::

    color='blue', width=210, name='one', height=10

This can be as fancy as you like, defining an entire domain-specific expression language.
But even small functions can give you a great bump in expressive power. For example,
add this and you get full relative arithmetic capability (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, and ``/``)::

    def relmath(value, currently):
        if isinstance(value, str):
            if value.startswith('*'):
                return currently * int(value[1:])
            elif value.startswith('/'):
                return currently / int(value[1:])
            else:
                return currently + int(value)
        else:
            return value

    ...

    options.magic(
        height = lambda v, cur: relmath(v, cur.height),
        width  = lambda v, cur: relmath(v, cur.width)
    )

Then::

    one.draw(width='*4', height='/2')

yields::

    color='blue', width=40, name='one', height=5

Magically interpreted parameters are the sort of thing that one doesn't need
very often or for every parameter--but when they're useful, they're *enormously*
useful and highly leveraged, leading to much simpler, much higher function APIs.
We call them 'magical' here because of the "auto-magical" interpretation, but
they are really just analogs of Python object properties. The magic function is
basically a "setter" for a dictionary element.

The Magic APIs
==============

The callables (usually functions, lambda expressions, static methods, or methods) called
to preform magical interpretation can be called with 1, 2, or 3 parameters.
``options`` inquires as to how many parameters the callable accepts. If it
accepts only 1, it will be the value passed in. Cleanups like "convert to upper case"
can be done, but no relative interpretation. If it accepts 2 arguments,
it will be called with the value and the current option mapping, in that order.
(NB this order reverses the way you may think logical. Caution advised.) If the
callable requires 3 parameters, it will be ``None``, value, current mapping. This
supports method calls, though has the defect of not really
passing in the current instance.

A decorator form, ``magical()`` is also supported. It must be given the
name of the key exactly::

    @options.magical('name')
    def capitalize_name(self, v, cur):
        return ' '.join(w.capitalize() for w in v.split())

The net is that you can provide just about any kind of callable.
But the meta-programming of the magic interpretation API could use a little work.

Subclassing
===========

Subclass options may differ from superclass options. Usually they will share
many options, but some may be added, and others removed. To modify the set of
available options, the subclass defines its options with the ``add()`` method to
the superclass options. This creates a layered
effect, just like ``push()`` for an instance. The difference is, ``push()`` does
not allow new options (keys) to be defined; ``add()`` does. It is also possible to
assign the special null object ``Prohibited``, which will disallow instances of the
subclass from setting those values.::

    options = Superclass.options.add(
        func   = None,
        prefix = Prohibited,  # was available in superclass, but not here
        suffix = Prohibited,  # ditto
    )

Because some of the "additions" can be prohibitions (i.e. removing
particular options from being set or used), this is "adding to" the superclass's
options in the sense of "adding a layer onto" rather than strict "adding
options."

An alternative is to copy (or restate) the superclass's options. That suits
cases where the subclass is highly independent, and where changes to the
superclass's options should not effect the subclass's options.
With ``add()``, they remain linked in the same way as instances and classes are.

Transients
==========

Some options do not make sense as permanent values--they are needed only as
transient settings in the context of individual calls. The special null value
``Transient`` can be assigned as an option value to signal this.

Flat Arguments
==============

Sometimes it's more elegant to provide some arguments as flat, sequential values
rather than by keyword. In this case, use the ``addflat()`` method::

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.options = Quoter.options.push(kwargs)
        self.options.addflat(args, ['prefix', 'suffix'])

to consume optional ``prefix`` and ``suffix`` flat arguments. This makes the following
equivalent::

    q1 = Quoter('[', ']')
    q2 = Quoter(prefix='[', suffix=']')

An explicit ``addflat()`` method is provided not as much for Zen of Python
reasons ("Explicit is better than implicit."), but because flat arguments are
commonly combined with abbreviation/shorthand conventions, which may require
some logic to implement. For example, if only a ``prefix`` is given as a flat
argument, you may want to use the same value to implicitly set the ``suffix``.
To this end, addflat returns the set of keys that it consumed::

        if args:
            used = self.options.addflat(args, ['prefix', 'suffix'])
            if 'suffix' not in used:
                self.options.suffix = self.options.prefix

Choosing Option Names
=====================

You can choose pretty much any option name that is a legitimate Python
keyword argument. The exceptions: Names that are already defined by
methods of ``Options`` or ``OptionsChain``. These are mapping-style
objects, so many of the method names of ``dict`` such as ``items``,
``values``, ``get``, and ``setdefault`` are off-limits. If you try
to define options with verboten names, a ``BadOptionName`` exception
will be raised. This will save you grief down the road.

Related Work
============

A huge amount of work, both in Python and beyond, has gone into
the effective management of configuration information.

 * Program defaults. Values pre-established by developers, often
   as ``ALL_UPPERCASE_IDENTIFIERS`` or as keyword default to
   functions.

 * Configuration file format parsers/formatters.
   Huge amounts of the INI, JSON, XML, and YAML specifications and
   toolchains, for example, are configuration-related.
   There are many. `anyconfig <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyconfig>`_
   is perhaps of interest for its flexibility.
   You could
   probably lump into this group binary data marshaling schemes
   such as ``pickle``.

 * Command-line argument parsers. These are all about taking configuration
   information from the command line.
   `argh <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argh>`_ is one I particularly
   like for its simple, declarative nature.
   (`aaargh <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aaargh>`_ is similar.)

 * System and environment introspection. The best known of these
   would be ``sys.argv`` and
   ``s.environ`` to get command line arguments and the values
   of operating system environment variables (especially when running
   on Unixy platforms). But any code that asks "Where am I running?"
   or "What is my IP address?" or otherwise inspects its current
   execution environment and configures itself accordingly
   is doing a form of configuration discovery.

 * Attribute-accessible dictionary objects. It is incredibly easy to
   create simple versions of this idea in Python--and rather tricky
   to create robust, full-featured versions. Caveat emptor.  `stuf
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stuf>`_ and `treedict
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/treedict>`_ are cream-of-the-crop
   implementations of this idea. I have not tried `confetti
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/confetti>`_ or
   `Yaco <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Yaco>`_, but they look like
   variations on the same theme.

 * The portion of Web frameworks concerned with getting and setting
   cookies, URL query and hash attributes, form variables, and/or
   HTML5 local storage. Not that
   these are particularly secure, scalable, or robust sources...but they're
   important configuration information nonetheless.

 * While slightly afield, database interface modules are often used for
   querying configuration information from SQL or NoSQL databases.

 * Some object metaprogramming systems. That's a mouthful, right?
   Well some modules implement metaclasses that change the basic
   behavior of objects. `value <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/value>`_
   for example provides very common-sense treatment of object
   instantiation with out all the Javaesque
   ``self.x = x; self.y = y; self.z = z`` repetition.
   ``options`` similarly redesigns how parameters should be passed
   and object values stored.

 * Combomatics. Many configuration-related modules combine two
   or more of these approaches. E.g.
   `yconf <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yconf>`_
   combines YAML config file parsing with ``argparse`` command
   line parsing. In the future, ``options`` will also follow
   this path. There's no need to take programmer time and
   attention for several different low-level
   configuration-related tasks.

 * Dependency injection frameworks are all about providing configuration
   information from outside code modules. They tend to be rather
   abstract and have a high "activation energy," but the more complex
   and composed-of-many-different-components your system is, the
   more valuable the "DI pattern" becomes.

 * Other things.
   `conflib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/conflib>`_, uses dictionary
   updates to stack
   default, global, and
   local settings; it also provides a measure of validation.

This diversity, while occasionally frustrating, makes some sense.
Configuration data, after all, is just "state," and "managing state"
is pretty much what all computing is about.
Pretty much every program has to do it. That so many use so
many different, home-grown ways is why there's such a good opportunity.

`Flask's documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/config/#configuring-from-files>`_ is
a real-world example of how "spread everywhere" this can be,
with some data coming from the program, some from files, some from
environment variables, some from Web-JSON, etc.

Notes
=====

 * This is a work in progress. The underlying techniques have been successfully
   used in multiple projects, but it remains in active development.
   The API may change over time. Swim at your own risk.

 * ``options`` undergoes frequent automated multi-version testing with
   `pytest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_
   and `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_. It is
   successfully packaged for, and tested against, Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.
   It additionally runs under, and is tested against, PyPy 2.1 (based on 2.7.3)
   though it has to work around a few bugs in the underlying ``stuf`` module
   to do so.
