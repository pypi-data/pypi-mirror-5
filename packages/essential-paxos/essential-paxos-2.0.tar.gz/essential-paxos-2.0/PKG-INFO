Description: 
        Essential Paxos provides basic implementations of the Paxos algorithm. The
        distinguishing characteristic of this implementation, as compared to other
        freely available and open-source implementations, is that this library is
        independent of application domains and networking infrastructures. Whereas most
        Paxos implementations are deeply and inextricably embedded within
        application-specific logic, this implementation focuses on encapsulating the
        Paxos algorithm within opaque and easily re-usable classes.
        
        This library provides an algorithmically correct Paxos implementation that may
        be used for educational purposes in addition to direct use in networked
        applications. This implementation is specifically designed to facilitate
        understanding of both the essential Paxos algorithm as well as the practical
        considerations that must be taken into account for real-world use.
