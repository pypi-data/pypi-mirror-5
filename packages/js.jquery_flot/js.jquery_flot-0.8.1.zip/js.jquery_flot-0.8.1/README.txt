js.jquery_flot
**************

Introduction
============

This library packages `flot`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`flot`: http://www.flotcharts.org

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_flot``) are published to some URL.
