def read(fh):
    '''
    Read sequences in FASTQ format; identifiers are on lines that begin with 
    at symbols ('@'), sequence follows on the next line, then a line that 
    begins and sequence is with a plus sign ('+') and finally the quality 
    scores on the subsequent line. Quality scores are encoded in Phred format,
    the type of which (either 32 or 64) is determined when the file is probed
    for opening. The scores are decoded into a list of integers. This function 
    is a generator that yields `Sequence` objects.

def probe(fh):
    '''
    Probe a file to determine whether or not it is a FASTQ file. That is,
    the first non-empty line should begin with a caret ('@') and the 3rd line
    following that first non-empty line should contain no character with
    ordinal value less than 32. If none of the characters have ordinal value
    less than 64, then the file is guessed to be encoded in Phred64, otherwise
    it is encoded in Phred32. This function will return False if the file is
    not in FASTQ format and will return a dictionary with the phred score and
    type ('fastq') if the file is FASTQ.
