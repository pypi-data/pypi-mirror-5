        *********************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jquery-placeholder-js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jquery-placeholder-js`: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-placeholder-js/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_placeholder``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``jquery_placeholder`` from ``js.jquery_placeholder`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_placeholder import jquery_placeholder
          >>> jquery_placeholder.need()
