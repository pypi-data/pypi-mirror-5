js.jquery_placeholder
*********************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery-placeholder-js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery-placeholder-js`: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-placeholder-js/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_placeholder``) are published to some URL.
