deb-pkg-tools: Debian packaging tools
=====================================

The Python package `deb-pkg-tools` is a collection of functions to work with
Debian packages and repositories. Some of those functions have a command line
interface (see below) because they're very convenient to use in shell scripts,
while other functions are meant to be called directly from Python code.

Status
------

On the one hand the `deb-pkg-tools` package is based on my experiences with
Debian packages and repositories over the past couple of years, however on the
other hand `deb-pkg-tools` itself is quite young. I'm working on automated
tests but coverage is far from 100%. In other words, most of the package should
work fine but you may find some rough edges here and there; please bear with me
as I iron out the kinks :-)

Installation and usage
----------------------

You can install the `deb-pkg-tools` package using the following command::

    $ pip install deb-pkg-tools

After installation you'll have the ``deb-pkg-tools`` program available::

    $ deb-pkg-tools --help
    Usage: deb-pkg-tools [OPTIONS]

    Supported options:

      -i, --inspect=FILE         inspect the metadata in a *.deb archive
      -b, --build=DIR            build a Debian package with `dpkg-deb --build'
      -u, --update-repo=DIR      create/update a trivial package repository
      -a, --activate-repo=DIR    enable `apt-get' to install packages from a
                                 trivial repository (assumes root access)
      -d, --deactivate-repo=DIR  cleans up after --activate-repo
                                 (assumes root access)
      -v, --verbose              make more noise
      -h, --help                 show this message and exit

If you're interested in using `deb-pkg-tools` as a Python module, please refer
to the function reference on `Read the Docs`_.
