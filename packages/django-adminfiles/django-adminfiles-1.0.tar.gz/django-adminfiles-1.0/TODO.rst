TODO
====

- Fix run_tests and short DB names deprecation warnings when running tests 
  on 1.3.

- Test and document snipshot integration and select dropdown integration.

- Add integration with plain FilePathField or FileField (for unobtrusive use
  with third-party apps).

- Make URLs in JS portable (by reversing "all" view to find out where
  we've been included in the URLconf).

- Link to online demo or video.
