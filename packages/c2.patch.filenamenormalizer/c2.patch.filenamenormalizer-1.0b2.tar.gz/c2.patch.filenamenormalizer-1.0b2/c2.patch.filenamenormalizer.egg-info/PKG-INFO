Description: Introduction
        ==============
        
        This patch product is for downloaded filename become strange ascii code in muluti-byte languages on Plone
        
        
        - When downloading file with Japanese name, downloaded file has some strange ascii coded name.
        
        - I think we should get file name that shows in Plone page.
        
        - This happens on all Plone version. I think if the file is named with multi byte code, this strange ascii name shows up.
        
        - Please, look at attached file to fix this problem for IE and Firefox. Other browsers, we are still working on it.

        c2.patch.filenamenormalizer Installation
        =============================================
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run
          ``easy_install c2.patch.filenamenormalizer``. Find out how to install setuptools
          (and EasyInstall) here:
          http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * Get `pythonproducts`_ and install it via::
        
               python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
          into your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``c2.patch.filenamenormalizer-configure.zcml`` in the
          ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
          should only contain this::
        
               <include package="c2.patch.filenamenormalizer" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``c2.patch.filenamenormalizer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                c2.patch.filenamenormalizer
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                c2.patch.filenamenormalizer
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
