.. TIE documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed May 15 08:42:33 2013.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to TIE's documentation!
===============================

.. note::
   The tie library is still a work in progress, and as such the api described 
   here is still subject to change. I'll do my best to keep changes to a 
   minimum after its first release, and more importantly to reflect those 
   changes in the documentation if and as they happen.

   Should you happen to notice any missing, outdated or plain wrong information,
   feel free to contact me through `github <https://github.com/raphigaziano>`_
   or via `email <r.gaziano@gmail.com>`_.

Dependencies
------------

- None! (Besides Python, obviously. TIE has been tested with python 2.7 & 3.2, 
  under both Linux & Windows.)
