Flask Lightningwolf Admin
-------------------------

LwAdmin is a set of macros, classes, and methods to assist in the creation of administrative panels based on the
bootstrap framework. At the moment we are working on the main section of the navigation and basic helpers for CRUD model.

The main assumptions of LwAdmin is not to restrict the coder. LwAdmin it is not a complete utility to be run
as it is `Flask-Admin <https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin/>`_

If you are just thinking about the basic CRUD scheme should rather think of using `Flask-Admin <https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin/>`_.
This plugin is to be useful only when you need a custom administration panel - creating new pages requires that in this case more work to gain same effect.

Versioning
++++++++++

The project uses the `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <http://semver.org/>`_. Work is currently underway,
but because Flask-LwAdmin is already being used in production enviroment then API changes occur only in case of change parameter **y** in (**0.y.z**)

Examples
