Flask Lightningwolf Admin
-------------------------

LwAdmin is a set of macros, classes, and methods to assist in the creation of administrative panels based on the
bootstrap framework. At the moment we are working on the main section of the navigation.

The main assumptions of LwAdmin is not to restrict the coder. LwAdmin it is not a complete utility to be run
as it is Flask-Admin

Currently, work is underway. Any opinion and ideas are welcome.

Check SAMPLE_PROJECT for basic use example. More advanced use in this moment can be check in:
