Description: .. vim: ft=rst nospell tw=80
        
        This is a library for verifying `YubiKey <http://www.yubico.com/yubikey>`_ OTP
        tokens. It includes both the low-level implementation for verifying tokens
        locally and clients for multiple versions of the Yubico validation web service.
        The primary audience is developers who wish to verify YubiKey tokens in their
        applications, presumably as part of a multi-factor authentication scheme. 
        
        For testing and experimenting, the included ``yubikey`` script simulates one or
        more YubiKey devices using a config file. It also includes utility commands
        such as a modhex converter. See ``yubikey -h`` for details.
        
        This also includes a command-line web service client called ``yubiclient``. See
        ``yubiclient -h`` for details.
