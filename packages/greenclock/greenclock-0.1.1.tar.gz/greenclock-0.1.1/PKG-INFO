Description: GreenClock
        ==========
        
        GreenClock is a time-based task scheduler using gevent
        
        With GreenClock, you can: Schedule a task to run every X seconds, daily, weekly, monthly, 
        or at certain times (such as application startup).
        
        GreenClock launches a green thread per task. Therefore every task will be executed in a concurrent manner,
        without blocking each other.

            print('Calling func_1() at ' + str(datetime.now()))
            time.sleep(2)
            print('Ended call to func_1() at ' + str(datetime.now()))
        
        def func_2():
            print('Calling func_2() at ' + str(datetime.now()))
