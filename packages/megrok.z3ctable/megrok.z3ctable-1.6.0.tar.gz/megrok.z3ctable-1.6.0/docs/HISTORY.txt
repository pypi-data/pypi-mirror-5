Changelog
=========

1.6.0 (2013-10-08)
------------------

* Using now `grokcore.layout` instead of `megrok.layout`


1.5.0 (2011-01-31)
------------------

* Adapted the grokkers for the latest versions of ``martian`` and
  ``grokcore.component``.


1.4.2 (2010-05-07)
------------------

* Migration from Dolmen's GIT to Zope's Subversion repository. MANIFEST has
  been removed while a license file has been added. `megrok.z3ctable` is under
  the ZPL license.


1.4.1 (2010-02-21)
------------------

* Cleaned out all the zope.app dependencies. Removed unused imports
  and re-structured the tests module. We are now using minimal
  dependencies.

* ``megrok.z3ctable`` now requires ``zope.component >= 3.9.1``. This
  means you have to use the latest ZTK KGS in your buildout. This KGS
  can be included via the groktoolkit.


1.4.0 (2010-01-16)
------------------

* Now using ztk versions and fixed it for z3c.table >= 0.8


1.3.0 (2009-09-24)
------------------

* Now Columns have their own grokker. Before that, they were treated
  as basic multi adapters. We now use a dedicated grokking component
  with explicit directives that can be auto-linked to context and
  table components. Read the test "test_implicit" in the ftests for
  more details. [trollfot]
