===================
FireWorks ToDo List
===================

FW Docs
=======

* describe passing of information as being like 'ports'

* Note: reserved spec keywords:
    * _tasks - a list of FireTasks to run
    * _priority - the priority of the FW
    * _dupefinder - a DupeFinder object, for avoiding duplicates
    * _queueadapter - values of the QueueAdapter dict to override
    * _allow_fizzled_parents - continue on FIZZLED parents

* Show to use RocketLauncher to run a particular fw_id (probably in the priorities tutorial) (note, this is already implemented, just needs documentation)

* Running different FireWorks on different resouces (FWorker category, FWorker query)

* Tell people how to run different EXE based on machine, ie.. by changing bashrc and using an alias

* Document all the features of Script Task

* Update all tutorials so config file is handled smoothly, not terribly...

* Update all tutorials so that FireWorks have names, and lpad get_fws command uses the name of the FireWork rather than the id.

* Detailed tutorial on implementing dynamic jobs

* Separate out the tutorial on running arbitrary Python code

* Give examples on how to implement certain things, e.g. a workflow where one step gives an output file used as input by the second step.

* Setting up logging

* Provide a video showing how things look in production. That way people get a quick feel for what's going to happen.

Major Features
==============

* Allow the server to submit jobs to workers (maybe using ssh-commands?)

* Put all worker config files in a central location on the server, rather than scatter them amongst worker nodes?

* More and better unit tests, e.g. unit tests of scripts

* Add way to monitor a file during the run

* Change templating language to Django templates, adds dependency on Django

FireTasks
=========

* Something to commit data to MongoDB

* Maybe a GridFS file storage task

* File movement tasks? including ssh transfer?

Misc.
=====

* Detect a blank config dir and give a proper error.

* Allow FireWorks to block ports so that a parent job cannot override a setting. Maybe this is not needed?

* Add stats, preferably using a MapReduce call for speed

* Clean up job_exists() calls - they are currently expensive!

* Only allow a job to be rerun if it and all children are in {FIZZLED, READY, WAITING, COMPLETED}

* Pitfall - putting the same FW in 2 workflows. Also note that RUNNING state updated a little bit after queue running state.

* No negative fw_ids needed when returning FWAction

* Go through logging, make sure it's sane
