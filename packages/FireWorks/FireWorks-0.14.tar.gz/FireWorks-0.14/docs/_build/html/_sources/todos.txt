===================
FireWorks ToDo List
===================

FW Docs
=======

* describe passing of information as being like 'ports'

* Note: reserved spec keywords:
    * _tasks - a list of FireTasks to run
    * _priority - the priority of the FW
    * _dupefinder - a DupeFinder object, for avoiding duplicates
    * _queueadapter - values of the QueueAdapter dict to override
    * _allow_fizzled_parents - continue on FIZZLED parents

* Show to use RocketLauncher to run a particular fw_id (probably in the priorities tutorial) (note, this is already implemented, just needs documentation)

* Tell people how to run different EXE based on machine, ie.. by changing bashrc and using an alias

* update the security tutorial to have a database-level administrator

* Document all the features of Script Task

* Update all tutorials so config file is handled smoothly, not terribly...m

* Document allow_fizzled_parents

Major Features
==============

* Add a checkpoint/restart function

* Allow the server to submit jobs to workers (maybe using ssh-commands?)

* Put all worker config files in a central location on the server, rather than scatter them amongst worker nodes?

* More and better unit tests, e.g. unit tests of scripts

* Add way to monitor a file during the run

FireTasks
=========

* Something to commit data to MongoDB

* Maybe a GridFS file storage task

* File movement tasks? including ssh transfer?

Misc.
=====

* The CANCELED state is pointless

* Detect a blank config dir and give a proper error.

* Finish all planned tutorials

* Allow FireWorks to block ports so that a parent job cannot override a setting. Maybe this is not needed?

* Install using pip only, not Github devleopers! Package the tutorial separately.

* Add stats

* Clean up job_exists() calls - they are currently expensive!

* Only allow a job to be rerun if it and all children are in {FIZZLED, READY, WAITING, COMPLETED}

* <INSTALL_DIR> is only installation from the perspective the the "develop" command to setup.py, which users won't think of as installation. Maybe clarify. Or add a launchpad command to tell you where the tutorial dir is.

* Pitfall - putting the same FW in 2 workflows. Also note that RUNNING state updated a little bit after queue running state.

* Add workflow state

* No negative fw_ids needed when returning FWAction

* Go through logging, make sure it's sane

* A way to refresh WF manually before marking them as fizzled - sometimes the "push" just doesn't work...
    * this should be simple - just find all RUNNING/RESERVED FWs and refresh their workflows...

* Do something interesting with Workflow metadata

* Make the FireWorker category actually do something

* Add names in test workflows
