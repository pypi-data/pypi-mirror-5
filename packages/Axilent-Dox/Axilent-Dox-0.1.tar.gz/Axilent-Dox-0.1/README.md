Other TODOs
---

Dox depends on [Sharrock](http://github.com/Axilent/sharrock), which currently requires a full installation of Django.  However Dox only really needs the Sharrock client â€“ not the server capabilities.  In the future we'll package up a client-only version of Sharrock, and Dox will use that, negating the need for a full Django install.
