    data. The basic algorithm:
        * if the amount is 0, return 0
        * divide the amount (in base units) by the largest power of 10
          possible; call the exponent e (e is max 9)
        * if e<9, the last digit of the resulting number cannot be 0; store it
          as d, and drop it (divide by 10); regardless, call the result n
        * output 1 + 10*(9*n + d - 1) + e
        * if e==9, we only know the resulting number is not zero, so output
          1 + 10*(n - 1) + 9
    (this is decodable, as d is in [1-9] and e is in [0-9])"""
