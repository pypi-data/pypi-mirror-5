Description: Hoard (CLI)
        ===========
        This utility allows you to pull variables for a project from your [treasure] `hoard
        <http://github.com/ghickman/hoard>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Use your favourite python package installer::
        
            pip install hoard-cli
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        Set your hoard url and default environment in ``~/.hoardrc``::
        
            [hoard]
            url=<some_url>
            env=dev
        
        
        Set your project name in your project's ``.hoard`` (ideally in your project's top level directory)::
        
            [hoard]
            project=<project_name>
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        List environments for a project, with overrides for project and env::
        
            hoard get [--project] [--env]
        
        
        Set one or more environment variables, with overrides for project and env::
        
            hoard set [--project] [--env] KEY=value [KEY=value,...]
        
        
        Delete one or more environment variables, with overrides for project and env::
        
            hoard rm [--project] [--env] KEY [KEY,...]
        
        
        Project specific commands, e.g. show the current project, list envs for current project, list all projects::
        
            hoard project [project] [--envs] [--all]
        
        
        Environment specific commands, e.g. show the current env, list all envs::
        
            hoard env [--all]
        
        
        Get your auth token from the server backend::
        
            hoard login
        
        
        Clear your local auth token::
        
            hoard logout
