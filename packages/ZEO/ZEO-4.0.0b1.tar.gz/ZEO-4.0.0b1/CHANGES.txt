CHANGES
=======

4.0.0b1 (2013-05-20)
--------------------

- Depend on ZODB >= 4.0.0b2

- Add support for Python 3.2 / 3.3.

4.0.0a1 (2012-11-19)
--------------------

First (in a long time) separate ZEO release.

Since ZODB 3.10.5:

- Storage servers now emit Serving and Closed events so subscribers
  can discover addresses when dynamic port assignment (bind to port 0)
  is used. This could, for example, be used to update address
  information in a ZooKeeper database.

- Client storages have a method, new_addr, that can be used to change
  the server address(es). This can be used, for example, to update a
  dynamically determined server address from information in a
  ZooKeeper database.
