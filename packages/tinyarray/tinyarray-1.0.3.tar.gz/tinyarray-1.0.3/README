Tinyarray
=========

Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes.  Common
operations on very small arrays are up to 35 times faster than with NumPy, and 3
times less memory is used to store them.  Tinyarrays are useful if you need many
small arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few large ones.  (The
resulting code is still much slower than C, but it may now be fast enough.)

Unlike Python's built-in tuples, Tinyarrays support mathematical operations like
element-wise addition and matrix multiplication.  Unlike Numpy arrays,
Tinyarrays can be used as dictionary keys because they are hashable and
immutable.

The module's interface is a subset of that of NumPy and thus should be familiar
to many.  Whenever an operation is missing from Tinyarray, NumPy functions can
be used directly with Tinyarrays.

Installation
------------

Prepared packages exist for Debian, Ubuntu, Windows, and Mac OS X.  Follow the
`installation instructions for "Kwant" <http://kwant-project/install>`_ up to
the point where Tinyarray has been installed.

``pip install tinyarray`` should also work.

Clone the Git repository with ::

    git clone http://git.kwant-project.org/tinyarray


Usage example
-------------

The following example shows that in simple cases Tinyarray works just as
NumPy. ::

    from math import sin, cos, sqrt
    import tinyarray as ta

    # Make a vector.
    v = ta.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

    # Make a rotation matrix.
    alpha = 0.77
    c, s = cos(alpha), sin(alpha)
    rot_z = ta.array([[c, -s, 0],
                      [s,  c, 0],
                      [0,  0, 1]])

    # Rotate the vector, normalize, and print it.
    v = ta.dot(rot_z, v)
    v /= sqrt(ta.dot(v, v))
    print v


Documentation
-------------

The module's interface is a basic subset of NumPy and hence should be familiar
to many Python programmers.  All functions are simplified versions of their
NumPy counterparts.  The module's docstring serves as main documentation.  To
see it, run in Python::

    import tinyarray as ta
    help(ta)

Or in the system shell::

    pydoc tinyarray
