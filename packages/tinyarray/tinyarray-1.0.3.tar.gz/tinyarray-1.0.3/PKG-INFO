Description: Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes.  Common
        operations on very small arrays are up to 35 times faster than with NumPy, and 3
        times less memory is used to store them.  Tinyarrays are useful if you need many
        small arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few large ones.  (The
        resulting code is still much slower than C, but it may now be fast enough.)
        
        Unlike Python's built-in tuples, Tinyarrays support mathematical operations like
        element-wise addition and matrix multiplication.  Unlike Numpy arrays,
        Tinyarrays can be used as dictionary keys because they are hashable and
        immutable.
        
        The module's interface is a subset of that of NumPy and thus should be familiar
        to many.  Whenever an operation is missing from Tinyarray, NumPy functions can
        be used directly with Tinyarrays.
