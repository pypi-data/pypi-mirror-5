Description: Tinyarray is a numerical array module for Python.  The multi-dimensional arrays
        it provides are best thought of as (possibly nested) tuples of numbers that,
        unlike Python's built-in tuples, support mathematical operations.  Like tuples,
        tinyarrays are hashable and immutable and thus can be used as dictionary keys.
        The module's interface is a subset of that of NumPy and hence should be familiar
        to many Python programmers.  Tinyarray has been heavily optimized for small
        arrays: For example, common operations on 1-d arrays of length 3 run up to 35
        times faster than with NumPy.  When storing many small arrays, memory
        consumption is reduced by a factor of 3.  In summary, Tinyarray is a more
        efficient alternative to NumPy when many separate small numerical arrays are to
        be used.
