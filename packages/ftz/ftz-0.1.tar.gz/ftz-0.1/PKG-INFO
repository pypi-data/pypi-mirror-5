Description: Denormal numbers ("denorms") are extremely nonzero small numbers (less than
        1.2-38 for single precision or 2.2e-308 in double precision) which are
        handled poorly on most modern archicectures. Instructions involving denormal 
        operands may run as much as 100 times slower than those involving standard
        floating point operands [1], giving rise to very odd performance bugs.
        
        This package contains optimized SSE code to flush denorms in numpy arrays
        to zero.
