# What is the Python Toolbox? #

The Python Toolbox is a collection of Python tools for various tasks. It
contains:

 - `python_toolbox.caching`: Tools for caching functions, class instances and
   properties.
 
 - `python_toolbox.cute_iter_tools`: Tools for manipulating iterables. Adds
   useful functions not found in Python's built-in `itertools`.
 
 - `python_toolbox.context_management`: Pimping up your context managers.
 
 - `python_toolbox.emitting`: A publisher-subscriber framework that doesn't
   abuse strings.
   
 - And many, *many* more! The Python Toolbox contains **100+** useful little
   tools.

# Not backward-compatible yet #

Please keep in mind that Python Toolbox is still in alpha stage, and that backward compatibility would *not* be maintained in this phase. 


# Roadmap #

## Present ##

Python Toolbox is at version 0.5.2, which is an alpha release. It's being used in production every day, but backward compatibility isn't guaranteed yet.

## Next tasks ##

Making Python Toolbox support Python 3.x, and the packaging arrangements necessary.

Adding more useful tools.

## Future ##

Make a 1.0 release and start maintaining backward compatibility.


# Mailing lists #

All general discussion happens at **[the Python Toolbox Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-toolbox)**. If you need help with the Python Toolbox, you're welcome to post your question and we'll try to help you.

The development mailing list is **[python-toolbox-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-toolbox-dev)**. This is where we discuss the development of the Python Toolbox itself.

If you want to be informed on new releases of the Python Toolbox, sign up for
**[the low-traffic python-toolbox-announce Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-toolbox-announce)**.

# Python versions #
 
The Python Toolbox supports Python versions 2.6 and 2.7.

It's tested on both CPython and PyPy 2.0. (Which runs Python 2.7.)

# Current state #

The Python Toolbox is at version 0.5.2, which is an alpha release. At this experimental stage of the project, backward compatibility will _not_ be maintained.
