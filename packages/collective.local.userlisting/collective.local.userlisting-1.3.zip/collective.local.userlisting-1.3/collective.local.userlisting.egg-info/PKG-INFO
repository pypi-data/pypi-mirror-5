        Content types have just to implement IUserListingAvailable.
        
        Add to the configure.zcml on your policy product::
        
          <include package="collective.local.userlisting" />
          <class class="my.package.content.MyContent.MyContent">
             <implements interface="collective.local.userlisting.interfaces.IUserListingAvailable" />
          </class>
