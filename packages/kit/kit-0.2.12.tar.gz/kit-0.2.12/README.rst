Kit
===

A configurable, lightweight framework that integrates Flask_, SQLAlchemy_, and
Celery_.

  * Configure all your applications and sessions from one file (cf.
    Quickstart_ for an example).

  * Run your project from the command line: Start the Werkzeug_ webserver,
    start Celery workers, start a shell in your project's context (using
    IPython_ if available), and start the Flower_ monitor using the ``kit``
    command line tool.

  * No more complicated import schemes: ``kit.Flask`` and ``kit.Celery`` always
    return the correct (and configured) application corresponding to the
    module.

  * Kit makes sure database connections are correctly handled (e.g. removed
    after each request and task) under the hood. You can configure this
    behavior via the ``kit.teardown_handler`` decorator.

Check out the ``examples/`` folder for a few sample applications or read the
full documentation on `GitHub pages`_.

*Kit is under development.*


Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install kit


Quickstart
----------

Sample configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

  root: '..'
  modules: ['my_project.startup']
  flasks:
    - modules: ['my_project.app', 'my_project.app.views']
      kwargs:
        static_folder: 'st'
      config:
        debug: yes
        testing: yes
    - modules: ['my_project.api']
  celeries:
    - modules: ['my_project.tasks']
      config:
        broker_url: 'redis://'
  sessions:
    db:
      url: 'mysql://...'
      engine:
        pool_recycle: 3600
      options:
        commit: yes
        raise: no


The following configuration options are available:

* ``root``: project root, will be added to your python path. Useful if your
  configuration files are in a subdirectory of your project (defaults to
  ``'.'``)

* ``modules``: list of modules to import (and that don't belong to an
  application).

* ``flasks``: list of Flask application settings. Each item has the following
  keys available:

  * ``modules``: list of modules where this application is used. Inside each
    of these modules, you can use ``kit.Flask(__name__)`` to recover this
    configured application. The application's name will be automatically
    generated from this list of modules.
  * ``kwargs``: dictionary of keyword arguments passed to the ``flask.Flask``
    constructor.
  * ``config``: dictionary of configuration options used to configure the
    application. Names are case insensitive so no need to uppercase them.

* ``celeries``: list of Celery application settings. Each item has the
  following keys available:

  * ``modules``: list of modules where this application is used. Inside each
    of these modules, you can use ``kit.Celery(__name__)`` to recover this
    configured application. The application's name will be automatically
    generated from this list of modules.
  * ``kwargs``: dictionary of keyword arguments passed to the
    ``celery.Celery`` constructor.
  * ``config``: dictionary of configuration options used to configure the
    application. Names are case insensitive so no need to uppercase them.

* ``sessions``: dictionary of sessions. The key is the session name (used
  as argument to ``kit.get_session``). Each item has the following
  settings available:

  * ``url``: the database url (defaults to ``sqlite://``)
  * ``kwargs``: dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to
    ``sqlalchemy.orm.sessionmaker``.
  * ``engine``: dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the bound engine's
    constructor.
  * ``options``: there are currently two options available:

    * ``commit``: whether or not to commit the session after each request
      or task (defaults to ``False``).
    * ``raise``: whether or not to reraise any errors found during commit
      (defaults to ``True``).

You can then manage your project using the ``kit`` command line tool:

* ``kit shell`` will start a shell in your project's environment (all
  applications and sessions will have been created and set up beforehand).
* ``kit server`` will run the Werkzeug server for one of your Flask
  applications (if several applications are found, you will be prompted to
  choose one).
* ``kit worker`` will start a Celery worker (if more than one Celery
  application exists in your project, you will be prompted to choose one).
* ``kit flower`` starts the Flower worker monitor.

``kit -h`` displays usage and the list of options available for each of these
commands.


Next steps
----------

To instantiate an application outside of the command line tool (for example
to run it on a different WSGI server), you can specify a ``path`` argument
to the ``kit.Flask`` function. This will load the kit before returning
the application. The ``path`` argument is available on all other functions as
well (for example to allow model access from an IPython notebook).
