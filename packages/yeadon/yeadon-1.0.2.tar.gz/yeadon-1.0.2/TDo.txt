-include uncertainty calculations
-PAGE 69 OF YEADON'90-II: THE VALUES FOR THE LEFT AND RIGHT LIMBS ARE THEN AVERAGED SINCE THE SIMULATION MODEL IS DESIGNED TO HAVE SYMMETRICAL INERTIA VALUES
-units for everything? SI		
-USE THE CORRECT COORD SYSTEM: Z DOWN? (GLOBAL)

in soliddraw "warning invalid value encountered in divide"...

YEADON'S PAPER HAD AN ERROR: CHECK THIS STUFF


SCALE ALL ALPHA VALUES TO DENSITY

location of hip centers is at (-t,0,0) and (t,0,0)

REPLACE ALL VARIABLES TO WORDS: L-->LEVEL etc, for readability
DIFFERENCES/NOTES/FIXES
-fixed body frame f is fixed in the pelvis, not defined oddly
-fix for b = (t1-t0)/t0 --> this should be okay now
-measurement differences
-neck calculation: i said it's a cylinder! =o
-i'm DEFINITELY rotating inertias in the wrong direction, should be doing inverse transform.
-altered the naming scheme, 0 starts instead of 1

110701 UPDATE
-----
modify measurements input, make a nice form for it
2d plotting
change "DOF" to "configuration"
sub functions: shift inertia (coordinate system)
sub functions: combine inertias
allow for more interactive DOF input
documentation
inverse kinematics

110706 UPDATE
------
combine inertia
delta coord system
plot vectors
STORE SEGMENT ENDPOINTS AND ROOT POINTS (pos) and (tip)
(tippos)
OTHER TODO
for BicycleParameters
	-need to write a function that gets position vectors
	-


    IN SEGMENT  THER ARE INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES, SOLIDOCM, THAT CAN BE LOCAL VARIABLES

    REMOVE UNCERTANTIES:
