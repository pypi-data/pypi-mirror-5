Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

#. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.behavior.localdiazo`` to the
   list of eggs to install::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.behavior.localdiazo

#. If you are using Plone 4.2.x you need to add the following also::

    [versions]
    ...
    plone.app.theming = 1.1.1

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.

Usage
^^^^^

In Plone's control panel go to 'Dexterity Content Types', select your content
type, go to the 'Behaviors' tab and enable the 'Local registry' and 'Local
Diazo theme' behaviors.
