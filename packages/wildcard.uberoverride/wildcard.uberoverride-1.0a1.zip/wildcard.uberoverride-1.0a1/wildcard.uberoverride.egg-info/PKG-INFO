Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package overrides the terrible UberSelectionWidget used in the collection
        portlet into a tree widget.
        
        It'll also convert the widget used in the collective.listingviews portlet to this
        new tree widget.
        
        This is a port from a project done long ago and unfortunately, there are no
        tests and it's possible it won't work perfect for you. You're encouraged
        to fix things and add issues to the tracker:
        https://github.com/collective/wildcard.uberoverride
        
        Make pull requests if you'd like additional form fields overridden.
