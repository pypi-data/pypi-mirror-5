Introduction
============

This package overrides the terrible UberSelectionWidget used in the collection
portlet into a tree widget.

It'll also convert the widget used in the collective.listingviews portlet to this
new tree widget.

This is a port from a project done long ago and unfortunately, there are no
tests and it's possible it won't work perfect for you. You're encouraged
to fix things and add issues to the tracker:
https://github.com/collective/wildcard.uberoverride

Make pull requests if you'd like additional form fields overridden.
