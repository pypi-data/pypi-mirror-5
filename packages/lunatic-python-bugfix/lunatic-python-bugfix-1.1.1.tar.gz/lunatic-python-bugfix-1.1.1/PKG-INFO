Description: Includes bugfixes on the original https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lunatic-python
         module.
        Lunatic Python is a two-way bridge between Python and Lua, allowing these
        languages to intercommunicate. Being two-way means that it allows Lua inside
        Python, Python inside Lua, Lua inside Python inside Lua, Python inside Lua
        inside Python, and so on.
