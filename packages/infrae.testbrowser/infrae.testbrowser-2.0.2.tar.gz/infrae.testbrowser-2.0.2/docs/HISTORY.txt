  was not properly quoted.

2.0.1 (2012/12/10)

2.0 (2012/09/24)

* Add the option ``follow_external_redirect`` for the standard
  browser, which let you redirect to a different domain, but that
  domain is still handled by the wsgi application (this modify browser
  options to the new domain).

* Add support for automatic JSON deserialization in a ``json``
  attribute for the standard browser.

* Improve expressions: add a type ``form`` to create forms out of the
  result of the expression, add a flag ``unique`` that makes possible
  for an expression to return only one value, or None if the
  expression didn't match.

* Improve support for arbitrary http methods by providing ``data`` and
  ``data_type`` parameters to the method ``open`` for the standard browser.

2.0b1 (2011/11/07)
------------------

* Add an initial support for test with Selenium 2. The Selenium
  browser takes a wsgi application as parameter and serves it using
  Python default wsgi server, in a thread, during the testing. The API
  of the Selenuim browser the one provided by the default one, in the
  measure of the possible.

* Fix various issues concerning encoding, to allow unicode strings at
  many places.

* Try to send back field values in the same order they are listed in
  the HTML document. Some systems use this to work.

* Fields are allowed, for most of then, to share the same name, even
  if they are not of the same type. In this case, you set a list
  instead of a value to the widget you fetched.

* Allow more things to be customized, like the hostname, port,
  protocol, the default wsgi environ. Some of those settings are
  customizable from the command line (same system than for Selenium).

* The browser is a now a context manager. You can register some
  actions to be executed at the end of context manager, using
  ``handlers``.
