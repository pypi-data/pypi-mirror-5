django-planet
=============

This is a generic application for Django projects aiming to provide a planet
feed aggregator app. 

It is compatible with `Pinax <http://pinaxproject.com/>`_ and its themed using `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_
and `Wave-Grind pattern as background from subtlepatter.com <http://subtlepatterns.com/wave-grind/>`_.

Django-planet is heavily based on `Feedjack's <http://www.feedjack.org/>`_ models by Gustavo Picon and my
django app that extends it: `feedjack-extension <http://code.google.com/p/feedjack-extension/>`_. Changes and addings to
models were inspired by `Mark Pilgrim's Feedparser <http://www.feedparser.org/>`_.
