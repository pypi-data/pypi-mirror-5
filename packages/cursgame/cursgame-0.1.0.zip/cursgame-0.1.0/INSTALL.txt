Cursgame uses an typical distutils installer. To install it do in a
text console:

python3 setup.py install

Please note that, depending on your OS and where you want to install
Cursgame, you may need administrative-privileges. Also note that the
python3 command may differ on different platforms. On Linux it's
usually python3 (if installed). On Windows it's just python, but
depends on how you PATH is configured (especially if you have more
than one python-version installed).
