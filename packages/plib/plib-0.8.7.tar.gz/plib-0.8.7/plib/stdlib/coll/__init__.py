This sub-package contains abstract base classes for
sequences and mappings that are built on the standard
Python collection ABCs, but with some additional features.

This sub-package also contains additional collection classes
with method names redefined for greater convenience. The
key desire here is to have the method names 'append' and
'next' refer to the methods that you *want* to call for
each collection to add and retrieve an item from the
"right" place (i.e., the "next" item for the given
collection). Thus:

fifo -- a deque; 'append' adds to the end of the queue,
    'next' retrieves from the start (i.e., 'popleft').

stack -- a list; 'append' adds to the end of the list,
    'next' retrieves from the end as well (i.e., 'pop').

Finally, two "utility" collection classes are provided,
``AttrDict`` and ``AttrList``; these allow mapping values
or sequence items to be accessed via attribute names as
well as by the normal subscripting syntax.
