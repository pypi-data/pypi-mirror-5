ad-1.1
======

- Changed the core usage to be compatible with all base numeric types (int, 
  float, long, and complex).

- Changed the main constructor name from ``adfloat`` to ``adnumber`` because of
  the full numeric support (not just for floats). The reasoning is because this
  package should simply provide a "wrapper"-ish functionality for derivative
  tracking (i.e., it shouldn't force the user to choose float objects if they
  don't want to.
  
- Added ``real`` and ``imag`` properties to ``ADF`` class.

- Updated all admath functions to work with their respective numeric types using
  the math and cmath module functions.

- Updated all admath function documentation to reflect basically the same as the
  math module.

- Added ``pi`` and ``e`` module members to admath.

- Added ``atan2``, ``isinf`` and ``isnan`` methods to admath.

- Updated ``log10``, ``log1p``, ``expm1``, and ``fabs`` in admath to use the 
  actual math or cmath module functions, mostly for their higher precision at 
  certain input values (see the math/cmath module documentation for more 
  details).
  
- Bug fix: ``log`` didn't default to base ``e`` before. It's fixed now.

ad-1.0.3
========

- Fixed an issue with using Numpy arrays as input to ``adfloat`` in Python 3.3.

- Renamed ``_calculate_derivatives`` method to more appropriately be called 
  ``_apply_chain_rule``.

ad-1.0.2
========

- Default constructor ``AD`` renamed to ``adfloat`` to follow general coding 
  guidelines better.
  
- Changed ``ADF(...)`` and ``ADV(...)`` to just ``ad(...)`` when printing out 
  the variables in either str or repr form (made a general printer--credits to
  EOL!).

- Updated the ``_get_variables`` method to not depend on the ``d(...)`` method, 
  but to access the hidden member ``_lc`` directly for getting first derivative
  variables.

- Renamed hidden member ``_hash`` to ``_trace``.

- Made the constructor for arrays more robust and now the tag is applied to all
  objects that get created.

- Constructor is updated to return a copy of another AD object if supplied as an
  input (i.e., ``x = adfloat(2); y = adfloat(x)``). This makes the two objects 
  equivalent, copying the nominal value and the derivatives, but naturally they 
  two objects are not identical (i.e., ``x==y`` returns ``True``, but ``x is y`` 
  returns ``False``).

- Added ``sqrt`` method to ``ADF`` class because some ``numpy`` functions look
  for this method of the objects it operates on (i.e., ``numpy.sqrt``, 
  ``numpy.std``, etc.). Also updated the ``sqrt`` function in the ``admath``
  module to actually use the ``math.sqrt`` method to perform the calculations.

ad-1.0.1
========
- Fixed some vectorization bugs

ad-1.0
======
- 1.0: Initial release. Nearly full differentiation support for all 
  math module functions.
