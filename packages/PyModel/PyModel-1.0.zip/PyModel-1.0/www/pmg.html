<p>
<a href="index.html">PyModel</a> is an open-source model-based testing
framework in Python.

<hr>

<p>
Usage:
</p>

<pre>
  pmg [options] fsm
</pre>

<p>
The single argument fsm is one <a href="concepts.html">finite state
machine</a> (FSM) module name (without the .py suffix).  The FSM is
typically produced by the PyModel
Analyzer, <a href="pma.html">pma</a>.  From the
FSM, <b>pmg</b> generates a file of commands in the
dot graph-drawing language.  This .dot file can then be processed by
the dot program in the Graphviz package from
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">www.graphviz.org</a>.  Use the
PyModel commands dotps, dotpdf, or dotsvg to run dot and produce
PostScript, PDF, or SVG, respectively. SVG files can be viewed in a
web browser.  
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, pma, pmg, and a dot program can all
be invoked by the <a href="pmv.html">pmv</a> program, so analysis and
display can be accomplished by a single command.
</p>

<p>
Control clutter in the graph with the <code>-l --transitionLabels</code> option:
<code>-l action</code> shows the action name, arguments, and return value,
<code>-l name</code> shows only the action name, and <code>-l none</code> shows no labels.
</p>

<p>
In the generated graphics, the initial state is gray.  Accepting
states have a double border.  Unexplored or incompletely explored
states are orange (these may have outgoing transitions that are
not shown).  Terminal states (with no outgoing transitions) that are
accepting states are green.  Terminal states that are not accepting
states are yellow; runs that end in these states are considered
failures.
</p>

<p>
In the browser, hover the pointer over a state to display a tooltip
that shows the state variables and their values.  Place the point of
the pointer over any pixel on a transition vector to display a tooltip
that shows the transition.
</p>

<p>
Options:
</p>

<pre>
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        Output file name (not including .dot), default is &lt;fsm argument&gt;
  -l TRANSITIONLABELS, --transitionLabels=TRANSITIONLABELS
                        Transition labels: action, name, or none, default is action       
  -x, --noStateTooltip  Omit tooltips from state bubbles (to work around dot svg problem)
