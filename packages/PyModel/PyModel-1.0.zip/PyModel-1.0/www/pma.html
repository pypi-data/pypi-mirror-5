<h2>PyModel Analyzer</h2>

<p>
<a href="index.html">PyModel</a> is an open-source model-based testing
framework in Python.

<hr>

<p>
Usage:
</p>


<pre>
  pma [options] models  
</pre>

<p>
models is a list of one or more module names (with no .py suffix).
Each module named in models must contain
a <a href="concepts.html">model</a>, that is: a model program, an FSM,
or a test suite.  In addition, a module named in models can contain
additional configuration information for a model program.  Multiple
models (model programs including configuration, FSMs, and test suites)
are composed into a product.  The analyzer generates a finite state
machine from the product and writes an FSM module that includes the
generated FSM, the explored states, and other results of the analysis.
</p>

<p>
The FSM module contents can be displayed using the PyModel Graphics
program, <a href="pmg.html">pmg</a>, and one of
the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> commands, dotps,
dotpdf, or dotsvg.  Alternatively, pma, pmg, and a dot program can all
be invoked by the <a href="pmv.html">pmv</a> program, so analysis and
display can be accomplished by a single command.

Options:
</p>
<pre>
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ACTION, --action=ACTION
                        Action to include in generated FSM, as many as needed,
                        if no -a include all actions
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude=EXCLUDE
                        Action to exclude from generated FSM, as many as
                        needed
  -m MAXTRANSITIONS, --maxTransitions=MAXTRANSITIONS
                        Maximum number of transitions to include in the
                        generated FSM, default 100
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        Output module name (with no .py suffix), default is
                        &lt;first argument&gt;FSM
