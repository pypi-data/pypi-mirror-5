PyModel Samples

There are some examples in the subdirectories under the pymodel
samples directory: ABP, Marquee, PowerSwitch, Socket, Stack,
WebApplication, etc.  For a description of each sample, see the README
in the samples directory and in each sample subdirectory.

Each sample subdirectory contains some test script modules: test.py,
test_graphics.py etc.  These scripts demonstrate the samples, as well
as testing PyModel itself.  

To execute test.py (etc.), type the command

 trun test

For this to work, the PyModel/pymodel directory must be on your Python
path, the current directory must be on your Python path, and the
PyModel/bin directory must be on your execution path.  To achieve all
this, you can run the PyModel/pymodel/pymodel_paths command.
Alternatively, if you have installed PyModel, these preliminaries may
not be necessary. Just type: trun test

Each test script contains commented command lines that demonstrate
combinations of arguments and options.  Running each test script
displays output on the terminal, and many test scripts also generate
files of graphic output in .svg, .pdf, or .ps format. The graphics
files can then be displayed by an appropriate viewer (for example,
.svg files can be displayed by many browsers).

Some samples directories contain svg/ subdirectories (etc.) with test
output files that we computed on our development system, so you can
view them without having to execute the tests scripts yourself.
(Executing the test scripts will not overwrite the contents of these
directories.)
