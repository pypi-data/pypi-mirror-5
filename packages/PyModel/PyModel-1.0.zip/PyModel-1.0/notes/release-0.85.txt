PyModel v. 0.85 release notes

The initial public release, v 0.80, appeared in January 2010.  Version
0.85 adds features that support "passive testing": automatically
checking log files (or other traces collected from instrumented
systems) against a model.  It also adds some improvements to the
graphics and a few conveniences and bug fixes.  In detail:

- pma, pmt: support observables attribute in model programs to
identify observable actions, which get action their argument values
from composed FSMs or test suites, not model program domains.
- pma: generate graphs for all the runs in a test suite, not just the first.
- pma, pmg: color terminal accepting states green and dead-end states yellow.
- pmg: add -l --transitionlabels option to control clutter on graphs.
- pmg: -o option now just identifies output file basename, pmg always adds .dot
- pma, pmt: show action return values properly in graphs and other output.
- samples: remove Mosaic sample, add/revise test cases in several samples.
- notes/*.txt and www/*.html: bring up to date.
