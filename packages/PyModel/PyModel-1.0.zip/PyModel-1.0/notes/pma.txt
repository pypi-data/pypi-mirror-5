Usage: pma [options] models  

PyModel Analyzer. models is a list of one or more module names (with
no .py suffix).  Each module named in models must contain a model,
that is: a model program, an FSM, or a test suite.  In addition, a
module named in models can contain additional configuration
information for a model program.  Multiple models (model programs
including configuration, FSMs, and test suites) are composed into a
product.  The analyzer generates a finite state machine from the
product and writes an FSM module that includes the generated FSM, the
explored states, and other results of the analysis.  The FSM module
contents can be displayed using the PyModel Graphics program pmg,
and one of the Graphviz commands, dotps, dotpdf, or dotsvg.
Alternatively, pma and a dot program can all be invoked by the pmv
program, so analysis and display can be accomplished by a single
command.


Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ACTION, --action=ACTION
                        Action to include in generated FSM, as many as needed,
                        if no -a include all actions
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude=EXCLUDE
                        Action to exclude from generated FSM, as many as
                        needed
  -m MAXTRANSITIONS, --maxTransitions=MAXTRANSITIONS
                        Maximum number of transitions to include in the
                        generated FSM, default 100
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        Output module name (with no .py suffix), default is
                        <first argument>FSM
