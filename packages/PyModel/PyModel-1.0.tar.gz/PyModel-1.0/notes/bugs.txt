PyModel bugs and limitations

 9 Sep 2012

In Socket/len_buffers_two.py, a pymodel config file, state_filter has
(lowercase with underscore) no effect.  Workaround: StateFilter (mixed
case) has the intended effect.


16 Sep 2012

The -e option doesn't have an effect on FSMs or TestStuites. For
example in Socket try

 pmt.py -e send_close -e recv_close -n  10 NoBlockScenario

in Stack try 

 pmt.py -e Pop Scenarios

When an FSM is composed with a model program and both contain (say)
action A, the effect of -e A on the product is that action A
interleaves with other actions; it behaves like an unshared action.

Workaround: write a different FSM or TestSuite without the actions you
wish to exclude.

FIXED for FSM 4 Dec 2012, for TestSuite 5 Dec 2012.
