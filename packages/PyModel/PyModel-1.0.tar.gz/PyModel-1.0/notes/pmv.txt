Usage: pmv [options] models  

PyModel Viewer.  A single program that invokes pma, pmg, and Graphviz
dot to to perform analysis, generate dot commands, and generate a file
of graphics in .svg, .pdf or another format.  The pmv program provides
brevity and convenience, so analysis and display can be accomplished
by a single command.  This program accepts all of the command line
options and arguments of both pma and pmg, and the -T option of dot
(to select the graphics format), then passes the options to the
appropriate program.

Options aemo are passed to pma, lxy are passed to pmg, T is passed to dot.
