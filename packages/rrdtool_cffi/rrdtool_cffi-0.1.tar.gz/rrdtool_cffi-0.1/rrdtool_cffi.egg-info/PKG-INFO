Description: Main goal is to have rrdtool available in pypy.
        The API is close to the bindings comming with rrdtool itself.
        It supports
        
        * python2.6
        * python2.7
        * python3.2
        * python3.3
        * pypy2.0
        
        You have to install the rrdtool library before using the bindings: ``apt-get install rrdtool``
        
        Furthermore the 'cffi' library must be present: ``apt-get install libffi-dev``
