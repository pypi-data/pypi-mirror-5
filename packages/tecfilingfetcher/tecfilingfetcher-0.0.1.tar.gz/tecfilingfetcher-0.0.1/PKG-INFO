Description: TEC Filing Fetcher
        ==================
        
        Fetching TEC filing data made easy!
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        Pretty straightforward:
        
        ::
        
            usage: fetchfiling [-h] [-t {contributions,expenditures}] [-s] filing_id
        
            positional arguments:
              filing_id             TEC filing ID
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -t {contributions,expenditures}, --type {contributions,expenditures}
                                    The type of data you want to get
              -s, --simple          Return just the basic fields, good if you just want
                                    numbers
