        List of gearman hosts to connect to.  See :py:mod:`gearman.worker` for

    **tasks**
        List of tasks.  Tasks may be Task() objects, dicts, lists or tuples.

        started in this run.
    **worker_class**
        GearmanWorker class to use.  Defaults to :py:class:`gearman.worker.GearmanWorker`.
        You could also use :py:class:`jsonclass.GearmanWorker`.
    **use_sighandler**
        Set to False if you would prefer to use your own signal handlers

    **verbose**
        Set to True to enable logger.
