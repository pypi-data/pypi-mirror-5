This document describes the basic zc.zrs design.

ZRS has two parts, a primary storage and a secondary storage.  Both
are ZODB storages.  They can be used with ZEO or directly in
applications.  A secondary storage is configured with one or more
addresses of primary storages.  It will try to connect to each address
until a connection succeeds.

When a secondary connects to a primary, it presents it's highest
committed transaction id.  The primary sends it all subsequent
transactions for as long as the secondary is running.  The secondary
restores these transactions as they are recieved from the primary.

From an application's point of view, a secondary is read-only.  An
application is not allowed to write to a secondary.

Primaries and secondaries are defined with other storages that actualy
store data.

We will support multiple versions of ZODB. 

Notes:

  - Current secondaries only work with FileStorage

  - We want extra features:

    o restore for secondaries

    o Ability to tell ZEO servers when new data comes in.

  - We don't support versions

  - We don't provide the backpointer optimization.
