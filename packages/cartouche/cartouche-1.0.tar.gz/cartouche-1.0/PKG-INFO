Description: Sphinx is a popular tool for documenting Python APIs which uses reStructuredText
        as a its lightweight markup language. Sphinx extends restructured text with
        semantic markup elements for documenting Python APIs but when these are used the
        ratio of markup to content becomes too high and readability is compromised
        enough that the docstring becomes unsuitable for use with standard Python
        introspection mechanisms like help() or IDEs.
        
        Cartouche is an a Sphinx extension which automatically converts a highly
        readable docstring format suitable for use with help() and IDEs to the
        reStructuredText hieroglyphics required by Sphinx.
