Description: 
        Constant-time string comparison
        -------------------------------
        
        Sometimes you need to test strings for equality with an algorithm whose timing depends
        only on the length of the strings, and not on the contents of the strings themselves. If
        one of those strings is of constant width -- an
        `HMAC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC>`_, for example -- then it becomes a constant-time
        operation. This can be used to prevent some `timing side-channel
        attacks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack>`_, such as `the critical vulnerability
        found in KeyCzar back in 2009 <http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/>`_.
        
        This module offers a single function, ``equals(x, y)``, which takes two strings ``x`` and
        ``y`` and returns ``True`` if they are equal, and ``False`` if they are not. The time
        this function takes does not depend on what specific bytes are in these strings. Unicode
        strings are encoded as UTF-8 before being compared; it is recommended that you only use
        this on byte strings (``str`` in Python 2, ``bytes`` in Python 3).
