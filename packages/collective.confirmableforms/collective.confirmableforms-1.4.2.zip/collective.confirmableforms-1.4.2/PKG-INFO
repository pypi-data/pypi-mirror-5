Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product adds a new emailer for Products.PloneFormGen. Our emailer
        is based on the default PFG one, but will first send an email to the
        person who submitted the form so he can confirm his email address.
        
        This products relies on PloneFormGen and collective.depositbox to
        store the data waiting for validation.
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Add ``collective.confirmableforms`` to your buildout and install it
        via Zope quick installer or Plone add-on control panel page.  First
        install ``PloneFormGen`` itself, then ``collective.confirmableforms``.
