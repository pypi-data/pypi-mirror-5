    An Experiment is a randomization between Treatments.

    Example:

    You could have 2 Treatments:
    - Prisoner's Dilemma with high payoff (users play for max reward of $5)
    - Prisoner's Dilemma with low payoff (users play for max reward of $1)

    You're interested in seeing how the payoff affects users' behavior.

    So, you define those 2 Treatments,
