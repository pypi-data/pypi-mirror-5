    Base class for all Matches.
    
    "Match" is used in the sense of "boxing match".

    It's a particular instance of a game being played,
    and holds the results of that instance, i.e. what the score was, who got paid what.

    Example of a Match: "dictator game between users Alice & Bob, where Alice gave $0.50"

    If a piece of data is specific to a particular player, you should store it in a Player object instead.
    For example, in the Prisoner's Dilemma, each Player has to decide between "Cooperate" and "Compete".
    You should store these on the Player object as player.decision,
    NOT "match.player_1_decision" and "match.player_2_decision".

    The only exception is if the game is asymmetric, and player_1_decision and player_2_decision have different data types.
