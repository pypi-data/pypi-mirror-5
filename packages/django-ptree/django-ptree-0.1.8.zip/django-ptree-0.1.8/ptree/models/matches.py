    Base class for all Matches.
    
    A Match is a particular instance of a game being played,
    and holds the results of that instance, i.e. what the score was, who got paid what.

    "Match" is used in the sense of "boxing match".
    
    Example of a Match: "dictator game between users Alice & Bob, where Alice gave $0.50"

    If a piece of data is specific to a particular participant, you should store it in a Participant object instead.
    For example, in the Prisoner's Dilemma, each Participant has to decide between "Cooperate" and "Compete".
    You should store these on the Participant object as participant.decision,
    NOT "match.participant_1_decision" and "match.participant_2_decision".

    The exception is if the game is asymmetric, and participant_1_decision and participant_2_decision have different data types.
