future: support Python 2 with fewer warts
=========================================

The ``future`` module helps run Python 3.x-compatible code under Python 2.

The goal of the ``future`` module is to allow you to write clean, modern Python
3.x-compatible code today and to run it with minimal effort under Python 2
alongside a Python 2 stack of dependencies.

It is designed to be used as follows:::

    from __future__ import division, absolute_import, print_function
    from future import common_iterators, disable_obsolete_builtins, super
    
    # Then Python 3-compatible code, e.g.
    for i in range(10**9):
        pass
    
    class verbose_list(list):
        def append(self, item):
            print('Adding an item')
            return super().append(item)    # new simpler super() function
    
    # These raise NotImplementedErrors:
    # apply(), cmp(), coerce(), xrange(), etc.
    

FAQ

:Q: Does it work?

:A: Probably not.


:Q: Who is this for?

:A: 1. People who would prefer to write clean, future-proof Python
       3.3+-compatible code, but whose day-jobs require that their code run on a
       Python 2 stack.

    2. People who wish to simplify migration of their codebases to Python 3.3+,
       module by module and feature by feature.

    3. People with existing or new Python 3.3+ codebases who wish to provide
       Python 2.6 and 2.7 support easily.

    4. People who like debugging crazy exceptions.


:Q: What is the relationship between this project and ``python-modernize``?

:A: python-modernize is great, and this project is designed to complement it.
    For a project wishing to migrate to Python 3, python-modernize is useful for
    starting the process of cleaning up legacy code idioms and translating code
    into a more modern idiom: a common subset of Python 3 and Python 2 that
    should run under either platform.

    ``future`` goes further in allowing the output of ``python-modernize`` or
    hand-written Python 3 code to run with less work and and less
    backward-compatible cruft on Python 2.


:Q: What is the relationship between this project and ``six``?

:A: ``future`` is a higher-level interface that builds on the ``six`` module.
    They share the same goal of supporting codebases that work on both Python 2 and
    Python 3 without modification. They differ in the interface they offer, the
    Python versions they target, and the amount of magic in the implementation.
    
    Codebases that use it are sometimes standard Python 3 code, sometimes
    Python 2 code, and sometimes six-specific wrapper interfaces.
    
    Here is a simple example of code compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3
    using ``six``::
    
        from six.moves import xrange
        for i in xrange(10**8):    # invalid Python 3 code
            pass
    
    Here is the corresponding example using the ``future`` module::
    
        from future import common_iterators
        for i in range(10**8):     # standard Python 3
            pass
    
    Note that the former introduces warty Python 2 cruft into a Python 3 codebase
    in order to offer Python 2 support. The latter example is standard Python 3
    code, with an import line that has no effect on Python 3.
    
    Another difference is version support: ``future`` supports only Python 2.6,
    Python 2.7, and Python 3.3+. In contrast, six is designed to support versions
    of Python prior to 2.6 and Python 3.0-3.2. Some of the interfaces provided by
    six (like the next() function) are superseded by features provided in Python
    2.6 and Python 2.7, such as ``from __future__ import print_function``.
    
    Another difference is that the implementation of ``future`` is more magical
    (i.e. evil). It does scary, ugly things so your code doesn't have to.


:Q: Can you support feature XYZ from the standard library in Python 3.3+ on
    Python 2.x?

:A: Probably not. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to support both
    platforms using standard Python 3 code, in order to facilitate Python 3
    adoption. Our goal is not to reimplement shiny new features from Python 3 in
    Python 2. That may be a worthwhile goal, but it belongs in a separate project.


:Q: How did the original need for this arise?

:A: In teaching Python to newbies, we faced a dilemma: teach them Python 3,
    which was future-proof but not as useful today because of weaker 3rd-party
    package support, or teach them Python 2, which was more useful today but would
    require them to unlearn various habits soon. We searched for ways to avoid
    polluting the world with more deprecated code.


:Q: Do you support Pypy and/or Jython?

:A: Not sure. This would be nice. Pull requests, please!


:Q: Should I use this in production?

:A: No! Maybe one day...


:Q: Can I help?

:A: Yes, we welcome bug reports, tests, and pull requests.
