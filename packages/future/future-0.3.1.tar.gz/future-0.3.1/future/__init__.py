future: clean single-source support for Python 3 and 2
======================================================

The ``future`` module helps run Python 3.x-compatible code under Python 2
with minimal code cruft.

The goal is to allow you to write clean, modern, forward-compatible
Python 3 code today and to run it with minimal effort under Python 2
alongside a Python 2 stack that may contain dependencies that have not
yet been ported to Python 3.

It is designed to be used as follows::

    from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                            unicode_literals)
    from future import *
    
followed by clean Python 3 code (with a few restrictions) that can run
unchanged on Python 2.7.

On Python 3, the ``from future import *`` line has no effect (i.e. zero
namespace pollution.) On Python 2 it shadows builtins to provide the
Python 3 semantics. (See below for the explicit import form.)

After the imports, this code runs identically on Python 3 and 2::
    
    # New iterable range object with slicing support
    for i in range(10**11)[:10]:
        pass
    
    # Other common iterators: map, reduce, zip
    my_iter = zip(range(3), ['a', 'b', 'c'])
    assert my_iter != list(my_iter)
    
    # New simpler super() function:
    class VerboseList(list):
        def append(self, item):
            print('Adding an item')
            super().append(item)
    
    # These raise NameErrors:
    # apply(), cmp(), coerce(), reduce(), xrange(), etc.
    
    # This identity is restored. This is normally valid on Py3 and Py2, but
    # 'from __future__ import unicode_literals' breaks it on Py2:
    assert isinstance('happy', str)
    
    # The round() function behaves as it does in Python 3, using "Banker's
    # Rounding" to the nearest even last digit:
    assert round(0.1250, 2) == 0.12
    
    # input() is now safe (no eval()):
    name = input('What is your name? ')
    print('Hello ' + name)


``future`` also supports the standard library reorganization (PEP 3108)
via import hooks, allowing standard library modules to be accessed under
their Python 3 names and locations::
    
    from future import standard_library
    
    import socketserver
    import queue
    import configparser
    import test.support
    from collections import UserList
    # and other moved modules and definitions

It also includes experimental backports for three stdlib packages from Py3
that were heavily refactored versus Py2::
    
    import html, html.entities, html.parser
    import http, http.server, http.client, http.cookies, http.cookiejar
    import urllib, urllib.parse, urllib.request, urllib.error

*Warning*: currently only html.* and http.client pass their test suites.


Explicit imports
----------------
If you prefer explicit imports, the explicit equivalent of the ``from
future import *`` line above is::
    
    from future.common_iterators import zip, map, filter
    from future.builtins import ascii, oct, hex, chr
    from future.modified_builtins import (range, super, round, input)
    from future.disable_obsolete_builtins import (apply, cmp, coerce,
            execfile, file, long, raw_input, reduce, reload, unicode,
            xrange, StandardError)
    from future.str_is_unicode import str

But please note that the API is still evolving rapidly.

See the docstrings for each of these modules for more info::

- future.standard_library
- future.common_iterators
- future.builtins
- future.modified_builtins
- future.disable_obsolete_builtins
- future.str_as_unicode


Automatic conversion
--------------------
An experimental script called ``futurize.py`` is included to aid in
making either Python 2 code or Python 3 code compatible with both
platforms using the ``future`` module. See
https://github.com/edschofield/python-future#automatic-conversion.
