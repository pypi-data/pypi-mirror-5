"""
A module that brings in equivalents of the new and modified Python 3
builtins into Py2. Has no effect on Py3.

The builtin functions are:

- ``ascii``
- ``hex``
- ``oct``
- ``chr`` (equivalent to ``unichr`` on Py2)
- ``input`` (equivalent to ``raw_input`` on Py2)

and:
- ``int`` (currently unchanged)

    # # accidentally by someone who forgets to import it but expects Python
    # # 3 semantics. So we delete it from __builtin__. We keep a copy

    # __builtin__._oldinput = __builtin__.input
