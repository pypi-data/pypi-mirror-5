future: clean single-source support for Python 3 and 2
======================================================

The ``future`` module helps run Python 3.x-compatible code under Python 2
with minimal code cruft.

The goal is to allow you to write clean, modern, forward-compatible
Python 3 code today and to run it with minimal effort under Python 2
alongside a Python 2 stack that may contain dependencies that have not
yet been ported to Python 3.

It is designed to be used as follows::

    from __future__ import (absolute_import, division,
                            print_function, unicode_literals)
    from future import standard_library
    from future.builtins import *
    
followed by clean Python 3 code (with a few restrictions) that can run
unchanged on Python 2.7.

After the imports, this code runs identically on Python 3 and 2::
    
    # Support for renamed standard library modules via import hooks
    from http.client import HttpConnection
    from itertools import filterfalse
    from test import support

    # Backported Py3-like bytes object
    b = bytes(b'ABCD')
    assert list(b) == [65, 66, 67, 68]
    assert repr(b) == "b'ABCD'"
    # These raise TypeErrors:
    # b + u'EFGH'
    # bytes(b',').join([u'Fred', u'Bill'])

    # New iterable range object with slicing support
    for i in range(10**15)[:10]:
        pass
    
    # Other iterators: map, zip, filter
    my_iter = zip(range(3), ['a', 'b', 'c'])
    assert my_iter != list(my_iter)
    
    # New simpler super() function:
    class VerboseList(list):
        def append(self, item):
            print('Adding an item')
            super().append(item)
    
    # These raise NameErrors:
    # apply(), cmp(), coerce(), reduce(), xrange(), etc.
    
    # This identity is restored. This is normally valid on Py3 and Py2,
    # but 'from __future__ import unicode_literals' breaks it on Py2:
    assert isinstance('happy', str)
    
    # The round() function behaves as it does in Python 3, using
    # "Banker's Rounding" to the nearest even last digit:
    assert round(0.1250, 2) == 0.12
    
    # input() replaces Py2's raw_input() (with no eval()):
    name = input('What is your name? ')
    print('Hello ' + name)


On Python 3, the import lines have zero effect (and zero namespace
pollution).

On Python 2, ``from future import standard_library`` installs
import hooks to allow renamed and moved standard library modules to be
imported from their new Py3 locations.

On Python 2, the ``from future.builtins import *`` line shadows builtins
to provide their Python 3 semantics. (See below for the explicit import
form.)


Standard library reorganization
-------------------------------
``future`` supports the standard library reorganization (PEP 3108)
via import hooks, allowing almost all moved standard library modules to be
accessed under their Python 3 names and locations in Python 2::
    
    from future import standard_library
    
    import socketserver
    import queue
    import configparser
    import test.support
    from collections import UserList
    from itertools import filterfalse, zip_longest
    # and other moved modules and definitions

It also includes backports for these stdlib packages from Py3 that were
heavily refactored versus Py2::
    
    import html, html.entities, html.parser
    import http, http.client

These currently are not supported, but we may support them in the
future::
    
    import http.server, http.cookies, http.cookiejar
    import urllib, urllib.parse, urllib.request, urllib.error


Utilities
---------
``future`` also provides some useful functions and decorators to ease backward
compatibility with Py2 in the ``future.utils`` module. These are a selection
of the most useful functions from ``six`` and various home-grown Py2/3
compatibility modules from various Python projects, such as Jinja2, Pandas,
IPython, and Django.

Examples::

    # Functions like print() expect __str__ on Py2 to return a byte
    string. This decorator maps the __str__ to __unicode__ on Py2 and
    defines __str__ to encode it as utf-8:

    from future.utils import python_2_unicode_compatible

    @python_2_unicode_compatible
    class MyClass(object):
        def __str__(self):
            return u'Unicode string: \u5b54\u5b50'
    a = MyClass()

    # This then prints the Chinese characters for Confucius:
    print(a)


    # Iterators on Py3 require a __next__() method, whereas on Py2 this
    # is called next(). This decorator allows Py3-style iterators to work
    # identically on Py2:

    @implements_iterator
    class Upper(object):
        def __init__(self, iterable):
            self._iter = iter(iterable)
        def __next__(self):                 # note the Py3 interface
            return next(self._iter).upper()
        def __iter__(self):
            return self

    print(list(Upper('hello')))
    # prints ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O']

On Python 3 these decorators are no-ops.


Explicit imports
----------------
If you prefer explicit imports, the explicit equivalent of the ``from
future.builtins import *`` line above is::
    
    from future.builtins.iterators import zip, map, filter
    from future.builtins.misc import ascii, oct, hex, chr, input
    from future.builtins.backports import bytes, range, super, round
    from future.builtins.disabled import (apply, cmp, coerce,
            execfile, file, long, raw_input, reduce, reload, unicode,
            xrange, StandardError)
    from future.builtins.str_is_unicode import str

But please note that the API is still evolving rapidly.

See the docstrings for each of these modules for more info::

- future.standard_library
- future.builtins
- future.utils


Automatic conversion
====================

There is an experimental script included called ``futurize`` to aid in making
either Python 2 code or Python 3 code compatible with both platforms using the
``future`` module. It is based on 2to3 and uses fixers from ``lib2to3``,
``lib3to2``, and ``python-modernize``.

For Python 2 code (the default), it runs the code through all the
appropriate 2to3 fixers to turn it into valid Python 3 code, and then
adds ``__future__`` and ``future`` package imports. For Python 3 code
(with the ``--from3`` command-line option), it fixes Py3-only syntax
(e.g.  metaclasses) and adds ``__future__`` and ``future`` imports to the
top of each module. In both cases, the result should be relatively clean
Py3-style code semantics that (hopefully) runs unchanged on both Python 2
and Python 3.

Forwards: 2 to both
--------------------
For example, running ``futurize`` turns this Python 2 code::
    
    import ConfigParser

    class Blah(object):
        pass
    print 'Hello',

into this code which runs on both Py2 and Py3::
    
    from __future__ import print_function
    from future import standard_library
    
    import configparser

    class Blah(object):
        pass
    print('Hello', end=' ')


Backwards: 3 to both
--------------------
Running ``futurize --from3`` turns this Python 3 code::
    
    import configparser

    class Blah:
        pass
    print('Hello', end=None)

into this code which runs on both Py2 and Py3::
    
    from __future__ import print_function
    from future import standard_library
    
    import configparser

    class Blah(object):
        pass
    print('Hello', end=None)

Notice that in both cases ``futurize`` forces a new-style class and
imports the renamed stdlib module under its Py3 name.

It also handles the following Python 3 features:

- keyword-only arguments
- metaclasses (using ``future.utils.with_metaclass``)

FAQ
===
:Q: Why use this approach?

:A: Here are some quotes:

- "Django's developers have found that attempting to write Python 3 code
  that's compatible with Python 2 is much more rewarding than the
  opposite." from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/python3/

- "Thanks to Python 3 being more strict about things than Python 2 (e.g., bytes
  vs. strings), the source translation [from Python 3 to 2] can be easier and
  more straightforward than from Python 2 to 3. Plus it gives you more direct
  experience developing in Python 3 which, since it is the future of Python, is
  a good thing long-term."
  from the official guide "Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3" by Brett Cannon:
  http://docs.python.org/2/howto/pyporting.html

- "Developer energy should be reserved for addressing real technical
  difficulties associated with the Python 3 transition (like distinguishing
  their 8-bit text strings from their binary data). They shouldn't be punished
  with additional code changes ..."
  also PEP 414: from http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0414/

- "Duplication of effort is wasteful, and replacing the various
  home-grown approaches with a standard feature usually ends up making
  things more readable, and interoperable as well." -- Guido van Rossum,
  from http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=86641.


:Q: Who is this for?

:A: 1. People who would prefer to write clean, future-proof Python
       3-compatible code, but whose day-jobs require that their code run on a
       Python 2 stack.

    2. People who wish to simplify migration of their codebases to Python 3.3+,
       module by module and feature by feature.

    3. People with existing or new Python 3 codebases who wish to provide
       Python 2.7 support easily.

    4. People who want to save time and reduce bugs with porting by not
       having to write their own home-grown Python 2/3 compatibility
       modules.


:Q: Why is there a need for this?

:A: "Python 2 is the next COBOL." - Alex Gaynor, at PyCon AU 2013

    Python 2.7 is the end of the Python 2 line. The language and standard
    libraries are improving only in Python 3.x. Python 3.3 is a better
    language and better set of standard libraries than Python 2.x in
    almost every way.

    ``future`` helps you to take advantage of the cleaner semantics of
    Python 3 code today while still supporting Python 2. The goal is to
    facilitate writing future-proof code and give the Python community an
    easier upgrade path to Python 3.
    

:Q: Are there any example of Python 2 packages ported to Python 3 using
``future`` and ``futurize``?

:A: Yes, an example is the port of ``xlwt``, available here::

- https://github.com/python-excel/xlwt/pull/32

The code also contains backports for several Py3 standard library modules
under ``future/standard_library/backports/``.


Other compatibility tools
-------------------------

:Q: What is the relationship between this project, ``2to3``, and
    ``lib2to3``?

:A: ``2to3`` is a powerful and flexible tool that can produce different
    styles of Python 3 code. It is, however, primarily designed for
    one-way porting efforts, for projects that can leave behind Python 2
    support.

    The example at the top of the ``2to3`` docs
    (http://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html) demonstrates this.
    After transformation by ``2to3``, ``example.py`` looks like this::

        def greet(name):
            print("Hello, {0}!".format(name))
        print("What's your name?")
        name = input()
        greet(name)

    This is Python 3 code that, although syntactically valid on Python 2,
    is semantically incorrect. On Python 2, it raises an exception for
    most inputs; worse, it allows arbitrary code execution by the user
    for specially crafted inputs because of the ``eval()`` executed by Python
    2's ``input()`` function.

    This is not an isolated example; almost every output of ``2to3`` will
    need modification to provide backward compatibility with Python 2.
    ``future`` is designed for just this purpose.

    ``future`` contains a script called ``futurize`` that is based on
    ``lib2to3`` and ``lib3to2`` and a select set of their fixers.
    ``futurize`` is designed to turn Python 2 (or Python 3) code into
    code that is compatible with both platforms.


:Q: Can't I maintain a Python 2 codebase and use 2to3 to automatically
    convert to Python 3 in the setup script?

:A: Yes, this is possible, and was originally the approach recommended by
    Python's core developers, but has some large drawbacks.
    
    First, your actual working codebase will be stuck with only Python
    2's features, and its warts, for as long as you need to retain Python
    2 compatibility. This may be at least 5 years for many projects.
    
    This approach also carries the significant disadvantage that you
    cannot apply patches submitted by Python 3 users against the
    auto-generated Python 3 code. (See
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNZ4OVO2Z_E.)


:Q: What is the relationship between this project and ``six``?

:A: ``future`` is a more comprehensive and higher-level interface that
    subsumes the ``six`` module (available as ``future.utils.six``).
    
    They share the same goal of making it possible to write a
    single-source codebase that works on both Python 2 and Python 3
    without modification. ``future`` provides a more complete set of support
    for Python 3's features and a cleaner interface (supporting standard Py3
    code). ``future`` also restores a few Py2 features that were removed from
    Python 3.
    
    Codebases that use ``six`` directly tend to be mixtures of
    Python 2 code, Python 3 code, and ``six``-specific wrapper
    interfaces. In practice it sometimes looks like this::
    
        from sklearn.externals.six.moves import (cStringIO as StringIO,
                                                 xrange)

        for i, (k, v) in enumerate(sorted(six.iteritems(params))):
            # ...

        if utils.PY3:
            exec(open('setup.py').read(), {'__name__'='__main__'})
        else:
            execfile('setup.py', {'__name__'='__main__'})
        
        for i in xrange(n):          # non-standard Python 3
            pass
    
    Such a mixture of interfaces puts a maintenance burden on the code to
    support both versions.

    Here is the equivalent code using the ``future`` module::
    
        from future import standard_library
        from future.builtins import range
        from future.utils.frompy2 import execfile

        for i, (k, v) in enumerate(sorted(params.items())):
            # ...

        execfile('setup.py', {'__name__'='__main__'})
        
        for i in range(n):
            pass
    
    which is standard Python 3 code except for the ``execfile`` function,
    which does not exist in Python 3 and has no clean, simple
    backward-portable equivalent because ``exec`` on Python 2 is a
    statement.

    Another difference is version support: ``future`` supports only
    Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+. In contrast, ``six`` is designed to
    support versions of Python prior to 2.7 and Python 3.0-3.1. Some of
    the interfaces provided by ``six`` (like the ``next()`` and
    ``print_()`` functions) are superseded by features introduced in
    Python 2.6 or 2.7. However, ``future`` incorporates the ``six``
    module as ``future.utils.six``.

    The final difference is in scope: ``future`` offers more backported
    features from Python 3, such as the improved no-argument
    ``super()`` function, the new ``range`` object (with slicing
    support), and rounding behaviour; ``future`` offers some backported
    stdlib modules such as ``urllib``; and ``future`` includes a
    set of other useful Py3k compatibility tools picked from other projects. 
    This should reduce the burden on every project to roll its own py3k
    compatibility wrapper module.

:Q: What is the relationship between this project and ``python-modernize``?

:A: ``python-future`` contains, in addition to the ``future``
    compatibility package, a ``futurize`` script that is similar to
    ``python-modernize.py`` in intent and design (based on ``2to3``).
    
    Whereas ``python-modernize`` converts Py2 code into a common
    subset of Python 2 and 3, with ``six`` as a run-time dependency,
    ``futurize`` converts either Py2 or Py3 code into a common subset of
    Python 2 and 3, with ``future`` as a run-time dependency.    

    Because ``future`` incorporates ``six`` and also provides more
    backported Py3 behaviours, the code resulting from ``futurize``
    should be cleaner and require less additional manual porting effort
    to handle renamed modules and modified builtins.

:Q: How did the original need for this arise?

:A: In teaching Python, we at Python Charmers faced a dilemma: teach
    people Python 3, which was future-proof but not as useful to them because
    of weaker 3rd-party package support, or teach them Python 2, which was
    more useful today but would require people to change their code and
    unlearn various habits soon. We searched for ways to avoid polluting the
    world with more deprecated code, but didn't find a good way.

    Also, in attempting to port packages such as ``scikit-learn`` to Python 3,
    I (Ed) was dissatisfied with how much code cruft was necessary to introduce
    to support Python 2 and 3 from a single codebase (the preferred porting
    option). 
    
    Since backward-compatibility with Python 2 may be necessary
    for at least the next 5 years, one of the promised benefits of Python
    3 -- cleaner code with fewer of Python 2's warts -- was difficult to
    realise before in practice in a single codebase that supported both
    platforms.


:Q: Do you support Pypy?

:A: Yes, except for the standard_library feature (currently).
    Feedback and pull requests are welcome!

:Q: Do you support IronPython and/or Jython?

:A: Not sure. This would be nice.


:Q: Can I help?

:A: Yes please :) I welcome bug reports, tests, and pull requests.
