This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single
feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of
Pythonect's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the
language's flavor and style. 

Pythonect is based on Python and uses many of its features. If you are
unfamiliar with Python, start with this `Python Tutorial
<http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html>`_.
