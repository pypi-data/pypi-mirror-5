    A SchevoController instance will look for configuration items whose
    keys begin with ``schevo.db.``, and open the corresponding
    database using the location given by that configuration item.

    During WSGI application invocation, a SchevoController attaches
    those same keys in the WSGI environment, with the values being the
    open Schevo databases.  It also attaches a key ``schevo.db``,
    which is a dictionary whose keys are the names of each database and
    whose values are the open Schevo databases.

    The SchevoController instance itself is injected into the WSGI
    environment with the key ``schevo.dbopener``.  This allows other
    components in the WSGI stack to call the `open` and `close`
    methods to open and close more databases, respectively.
