Description: 
        Czech Holidays
        ==============
        
        Python package with `Czech public holidays <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_Czech_Republic>`_.
        
        Status: ACTIVE
        --------------
        
        Under active development and maintenance.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The Cheese Shop::
        
            pip install czech-holidays
        
        In case you have an adventurous mind, give a try to the source::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/honzajavorek/czech-holidays.git#egg=czech-holidays
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Czech Holidays provide simple interface:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from czech_holidays import holidays
            >>> holidays
            [Holiday(2013, 1, 1), Holiday(2013, 1, 1), Holiday(2013, 4, 1), Holiday(2013, 5, 1), Holiday(2013, 5, 8), Holiday(2013, 7, 5), Holiday(2013, 7, 6), Holiday(2013, 9, 28), Holiday(2013, 10, 28), Holiday(2013, 11, 17), Holiday(2013, 12, 24), Holiday(2013, 12, 25), Holiday(2013, 12, 26)]
        
        Two shortcuts are available:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> holidays.easter
            Holiday(2013, 4, 1)
            >>> holidays.christmas
            Holiday(2013, 12, 24)
        
        Otherwise ``holidays`` behaves as an ordinary ``list``. If you need holidays
        for different year, you can make your own ``Holidays`` object:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from czech_holidays import Holidays
            >>> holidays = Holidays(2020)
            >>> holidays.easter
            Holiday(2020, 4, 13)
        
        ``Holiday`` object behaves as an ordinary ``datetime.date`` object:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from czech_holidays import holidays
            >>> holiday = holidays[5]  # arbitrary holiday
            >>> holiday.day
            5
            >>> holiday.year
            2013
            >>> from datetime import timedelta
            >>> holidays[5] + timedelta(days=4)
            datetime.date(2013, 7, 9)
        
        It also has some extra properties:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> holiday.name
            u'Den slovansk\xfdch v\u011brozv\u011bst\u016f Cyrila a Metod\u011bje'
            >>> holiday.name_en
            u'Saints Cyril and Methodius Day'
        
        Aim of this library is to simplify work with Czech public holidays in current
        applications, thus **it does not provide any historical data**. For example,
        *Restoration Day of the Independent Czech State* is celebrated since 2000,
        but the library returns it also for, let's say, 1978.
