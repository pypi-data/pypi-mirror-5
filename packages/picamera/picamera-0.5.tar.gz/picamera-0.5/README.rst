picamera
========

This package provides a pure Python interface to the `Raspberry Pi`_ `camera`_
module.

The project is written to be compatible with `Python`_ 2.7 from the 2.x series
(it will not work with 2.6 or below), and Python 3.2 or above from the 3.x
series. The same codebase supports both Python 2 and 3 with no conversions
(e.g. ``2to3``) required.

The code is licensed under the `BSD license`_. Packages can be downloaded from
the project `homepage`_ on PyPI. The `source code`_ can be obtained from
GitHub, which also hosts the `bug tracker`_. The `documentation`_ (which
includes installation, quick-start examples, and the change-log) can be read on
ReadTheDocs.


To do
=====

Major things that still need work:

* Video tests

* Future work - text overlay on preview (GLES?)
