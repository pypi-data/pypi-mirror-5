        Features
        ========
        
        * Frontend: Dynamic DNS updates via dyndns2 protocol (like supported
          by many DSL/cable routers and client software).
        * Backend: Uses DYNAMIC DNS UPDATE protocol (RFC 2136) to update compatible
          nameservers like BIND, PowerDNS and others (the nameserver itself is NOT
          included).
        * Easy and simple web interface.
        * Multiple Hosts per user
        * Add own domains / nameservers (public or only for yourself)
        * Supports IP v4 and v6, SSL.
        * Login with local or remote accounts (google, github, bitbucket, ...
          accounts - everything supported by python-social-auth package)
        * Manual IP updates via web interface
        * Shows time since last update via api, whether it used SSL or not
        * Made with security in mind
        * No nagging, no spamming - trying not to annoy users
        * Free and Open Source Software
        * Made with Python and Django
