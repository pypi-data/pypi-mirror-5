Description: 
        A set of python modules implementing red black trees is provided.
        
        Red-black trees are a little slower than treaps (some question this), but they give a nice
        low standard deviation in operation times, and this code is quite flexible.
        
        Modules are provided for red black trees that enforce uniqueness, and red black trees that allow duplicates.
        They also allow for set-like use and dictionary-like use.
        
        Much of the work here was done by Duncan G. Smith.  Dan just put some finishing touches on it.
