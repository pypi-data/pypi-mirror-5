Description: pytest-flakes
        =============
        
        py.test plugin for efficiently checking python source with pyflakes.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        install via::
        
            pip install pytest-flakes
        
        if you then type::
        
            py.test --flakes
        
        every file ending in ``.py`` will be discovered and run through pyflakes,
        starting from the command line arguments.
        
        
        Configuring pyflakes options per project and file
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        You may configure pyflakes-checking options for your project
        by adding an ``flakes-ignore`` entry to your ``setup.cfg``
        or ``setup.cfg`` file like this::
        
            # content of setup.cfg
            [pytest]
            flakes-ignore = UnusedImport
        
        This would globally prevent complaints about two whitespace issues.
        Rerunning with the above example will now look better::
        
            $ py.test -q --flakes
            collecting ... collected 1 items
            .
            1 passed in 0.01 seconds
        
        If you have some files where you want to specifically ignore
        some errors or warnings you can start a flakes-ignore line with
        a glob-pattern and a space-separated list of codes::
        
            # content of setup.cfg
            [pytest]
            flakes-ignore =
                *.py UnusedImport
                doc/conf.py ALL
        
        
        Running pyflakes checks and no other tests
        ------------------------------------------
        
        You can also restrict your test run to only perform "flakes" tests
        and not any other tests by typing::
        
            py.test --flakes -m flakes
        
        If you are using pytest < 2.4.x, then use the following::
        
            py.test --flakes -k flakes
        
        This will only run tests that are marked with the "flakes" keyword
        which is added for the flakes test items added by this plugin.
        
        
        Ignoring some errors
        --------------------
        
        You can ignore errors per line by appending special comments to them like this::
        
            import sys # noqa
            app # pragma: no flakes
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        The repository of this plugin is at https://github.com/fschulze/pytest-flakes
        
        For more info on py.test see http://pytest.org
        
        The code is partially based on Ronny Pfannschmidt's pytest-codecheckers plugin
        and Holger Krekel's pytest-pep8.
