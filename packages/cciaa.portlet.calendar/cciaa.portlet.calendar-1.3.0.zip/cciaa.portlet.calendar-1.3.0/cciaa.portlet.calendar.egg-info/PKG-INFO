Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a simple replacement of Plone base calendar, that add only some new features
        and change somw behaviour for better *accessibility*.
        
        Why show a search when only an event is found?
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        In the basic Plone calendar, when you click on a day with one event inside, you are
        redirected to a search result view... where the only clickable thing is the event itself.
        
        This step is a waste of time. This new calendar will move you directly to the event itself.
        
        Why show a search (in any case)?
        --------------------------------
        
        Showing a search results view when using the calendar is not very user-friendly. The user
        will read "*Results for the search...*" but from his point of view this action is not a search
        operation.
        
        This calendar will move the user to a specific view, with better explanatory texts.

        New feature: events of the month
        --------------------------------
        
        Simple, but useful: clicking on the month name will redirect the user to a view that display
        all event of the month.
