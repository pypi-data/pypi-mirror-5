Introduction
============

This is a simple replacement of Plone base calendar, that add only some new features
and change somw behaviour for better *accessibility*.

Why show a search when only an event is found?
----------------------------------------------

In the basic Plone calendar, when you click on a day with one event inside, you are
redirected to a search result view... where the only clickable thing is the event itself.

This step is a waste of time. This new calendar will move you directly to the event itself.

Why show a search (in any case)?
--------------------------------

Showing a search results view when using the calendar is not very user-friendly. The user
will read "*Results for the search...*" but from his point of view this action is not a search
operation.

This calendar will move the user to a specific view, with better explanatory texts.

New feature: events of the month
--------------------------------

Simple, but useful: clicking on the month name will redirect the user to a view that display
all event of the month.
