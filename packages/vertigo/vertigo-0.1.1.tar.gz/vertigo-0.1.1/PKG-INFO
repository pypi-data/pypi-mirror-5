Description: =========================================
         Vertigo: Some really simple graph tools
        =========================================
        
        Vertigo is a small collection of classes and functions for building and working
        with graphs with labeled edges. This is useful because dictionaries are just
        graphs with labeled edges, and objects in Python are just dictionaries, so
        really this applies to pretty much all objects.
        
        Such documentation as exists is mixed in with the code, because there really
        isn't that much code and you should just go read it. You can browse the source
        at <https://github.com/dplepage/vertigo>.
