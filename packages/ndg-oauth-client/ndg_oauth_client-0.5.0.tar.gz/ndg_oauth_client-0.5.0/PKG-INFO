Description: This is an OAuth 2.0 client library and WSGI middleware filter.
        
        It supports simple string-based bearer token and a custom extension to enable 
        the use of X.509 certificates as tokens.  The latter has been added to enable
        a SLCS (Short-lived Credential Service) to issue delegated X.509-based 
        credentials using OAuth.
        
        Releases
        ========
        0.5.0
        -----
        New pseudo release to keep in sync with ndg_oauth_server package versioning. No
        changes from 0.4.0.  New ndg_oauth_server 0.5.0 contains enhancements from W
        Engen including support for password based authentication for clients. See
        ndg_oauth_server package for details.
        
        0.4.0
        -----
         * Revised examples in ndg.oauth.client.examples.  bearer_tok uses bearer token
           to secure access to a simple html page on a resource server, slcs is an 
           example protecting a short-lived credential service aka Online Certificate 
           Authority.  This requires the ContrailOnlineCAClient package and should be 
           used in conjunction with the equivalent example in the ndg_oauth_server 
           example.
         * Revised ndg.oauth.client.lib.oauth2client.Oauth2Client to include support for
           bearer access token passed in Authorization header to resource server.
