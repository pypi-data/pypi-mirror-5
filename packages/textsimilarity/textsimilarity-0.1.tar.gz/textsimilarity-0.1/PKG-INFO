Description: This module will compare two text
            s for their similarity.
            Based on the similarity it will give a number
            between 0 and 1. 1 means both text are similary.
            0 means texts are completely different. A
            value in between 0 and 1 indicates how much they are similar.
            The algorithm uses an n-grams model and cosine similarity.
