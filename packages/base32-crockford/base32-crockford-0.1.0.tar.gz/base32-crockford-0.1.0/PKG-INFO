Description: 
        base32-crockford
        ================
        
        A Python module implementing the alternate base32 encoding as described
        by Douglas Crockford at: http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html.
        
        According to his description, the encoding is designed to:
        
           * Be human and machine readable
           * Be compact
           * Be error resistant
           * Be pronounceable
        
        It uses a symbol set of 10 digits and 22 letters, excluding I, L O and
        U. When decoding, the letters 'i' and 'l' are converted to '1' and 'o'
        is converted to '0'. Decoding is not case sensitive and encoding uses
        only upper-case characters.
        
        Hyphens may be present anywhere in a symbol string to improve
        readability and are ignored when decoding.
        
        A check symbol may be appended to a symbol string for error detection
        when decoding the string.
