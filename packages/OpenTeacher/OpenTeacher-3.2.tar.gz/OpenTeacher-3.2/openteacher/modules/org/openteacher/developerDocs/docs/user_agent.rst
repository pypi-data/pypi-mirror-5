==========
User agent
==========

**OpenTeacher user agents are constructed this way:**

- ``OpenTeacher/{major_version}.{minor_version} (+http://openteacher.org/)``
- replace the values between {}-signs.

Some copy/paste ready user agents of the versions currently worked on:

- ``OpenTeacher/3.2 (+http://openteacher.org/)``

Keep in mind that the user agent is available via the `metadata module`_,
so you don't have to construct it yourself in practise.

.. _`metadata module`: ../modules/org/openteacher/metadata.html
