While teachers still provide the information, OpenTeacher can help the students learn this information by themselves. It can <strong>improve the student\'s results</strong> and saves the teacher time.')!@</p>
	<p>@!tr('<strong>Transferring information</strong> from the teacher to the student can be done easily thanks to the OpenTeacher file format. The teacher creates an OpenTeacher file with the information (s)he wants to teach, sends it to the students, and the students can use OpenTeacher to be taught and tested about this. In addition, more and more publishers of (especially) language education books provide word list files along with their books. OpenTeacher can read many file formats, including the popular T2K (Teach2000), Wrts, and ABBYY Lingvo Tutor.')!@</p>
