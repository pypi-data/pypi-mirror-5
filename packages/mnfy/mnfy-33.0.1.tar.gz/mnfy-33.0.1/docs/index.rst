What the heck is mnfy for?
--------------------------

The mnfy project was created for two reasons:

* To show that shipping bytecode files without source, as a form of obfuscation,
  is not the best option available
* Provide a minification of Python source code when total byte size of source
  code is paramount

When people ship Python code as only bytecode files (i.e. only ``.pyo`` files
and no ``.py`` files), there are couple drawbacks. First and foremost, it
prevents users from using your code with all available Python interpreters such
as Jython_ and IronPython_. Another drawback is that it is a poor form of
obfuscation as projects like Meta_ allow you to take bytecode and
reverse-engineer the original source code as enough details are kept that the
only details missing are single-line comments.

When the total number of bytes used to ship Python code is paramount, then
you want to minify the source code. Bytecode files actually contain so much
detail that the space savings can be miniscule (e.g. the ``decimal`` module from
Python's standard libary, which is the largest single file in the stdlib, has a
bytecode file that is only 5% smaller than its original source code).


Usage
=====

A note about version numbers and Python version compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------

The version number for mnfy is `PEP 386`_ compliant, taking the form of
``PPP.FFF.BBB``. The ``FFF.BBB`` represents the feature and bugfix version
numbers of mnfy itself. The ``PPP`` portion of the version number represents the
Python version that mnfy is compatible with:
``'{}{}'.format(*sys.version_info[:2])``.

The Python version that mnfy is compatible with is directly embedded in the version
number as Python's AST is not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible. This means
that you should use each version of mnfy with a specific version of Python.
Since mnfy works with source code and not bytecode you can safely use
mnfy on code that must be backwards-compatible with older versions of Python,
just make sure the interpreter you use with mnfy is correct and can parse the
source code (e.g. just because
the latest version of mnfy only works with Python 3.3 does not mean you cannot
use that release against source code that must work with Python 3.2, just make
sure to use a Python 3.3 interpreter with mnfy and that the source code can be
read by a Python 3.3 interpreter).

Command-line Usage
------------------

**TL;DR**: pass the file you want to minify as an argument to mnfy and it will
print to stdout the source code minified such that the AST is **exactly** the
same as the original source code. To get transformations that will change the
AST to varying degrees you will need to specificy various flags.

See the help message for the project for full instructions on usage::

  python3 -m mnfy -h
  python3 mnfy.py -h

Transformations
===============

Source emission
----------------------------------------

.. _source emission:

If you want no change to the AST compared to the original source code then you
want mnfy's default behaviour of only emitting source code with not AST changes.
Any tricks with source code formatting have been verified by passing Python's
standard library through mnfy with only source emission used and comparing
the result AST for no changes.

As an example of what source emission does, this code (32 characters)::

  if True:
    x = 5 + 2
    y = 9 - 1

becomes (19 characters)::

  if True:x=5+2;y=9-1


Safe transformations
----------------------------------------------------

For a transformation to be considered safe it must semantically equivalent to
running the code as ``python3 -OO`` but can lead to a change in the AST. As the
changes are semantically safe there is only a single option to turn on these
transformations.

Combine imports
+++++++++++++++

Take imports that are sequentially next to each other and put them on the same
line **without** changing the import order.

From::

  import X  # 8 characters
  import Y  # 8 characters; 16 total

to::

  import X,Y  # 10 characters

From::

  from X import y  # 15 characters
  from X import z  # 15 characters; 30 total

to::

  from X import y,z  # 17 characters


Combine ``with`` statements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As of Python 3.2, `contextlib.nested()`_ is essentially syntactically supported.

From::

  with A:
   with B:pass

to::

  with A,B:pass


Eliminate unused constants
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If a constant isn't used then there is no need to keep it around. This primarily
eliminates docstrings. If any block becomes completely empty then a ``pass``
statement is inserted.

From::

  def bacon():
   """Docstring"""

to::

  def bacon():pass


From::

  if X:pass
  else:4+2

to::

  if X:pass


Integer constants to power
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For sufficiently large integer constants, it saves space to use the power
operator (``**``). Only numbers of base 2 and 10 are used as that is what
directly supported by the `math module`_.

From::

  4294967296

to::

  2**32


Sane transformations
------------------------------------------------

For typical code, sane transformations should be fine (e.g. you are not
introspecting local variables). Since these transformations are typically safe
you can turn them all on with a single option, but they can also be switched on
individually as desired.

.. note::
    Currently there are no sane transformations defined. See the
    `issue tracker`_ for some proposed transformations.

Unsafe transformations
------------------------------------------

For the more adventurous who know what features of Python their code relies on,
unsafe transformations can be used. Just be very aware of what your code depends
on before using any specific transformation. For this reason each unsafe
transformation must be switched on individually.


Function to lambda
++++++++++++++++++

This is unsafe as lambda functions are not exactly like a function (e.g.
lambda functions do not have a ``__name__`` attribute).

From::

  def identity(x):return x

to::

  x=lambda x:x
