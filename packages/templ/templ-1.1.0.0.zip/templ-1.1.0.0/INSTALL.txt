To install templ, run the following command:
    python setup.py install

The setup script uses the python setuptools package: if a suitable version of
setuptools is not present on the system, the script will automatically attempt
to download one. If you do not have internet access or prefer to install the
setuptools yourself, please see
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions>

Templ might require Python 2.7 (or later 2.* versions), I'm honestly not
sure.

If you have problems installing, see the Contact Information section in
README.txt.
