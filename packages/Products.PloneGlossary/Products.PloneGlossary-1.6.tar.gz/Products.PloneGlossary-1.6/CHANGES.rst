1.6 (2013-08-26)
================

- Change the condition for ``ploneglossary.css`` so it does not give
  an error when accessing the Dexterity control panel, which does not
  allow access to ``meta_type``.  Note that if you have customized
  PloneGlossary and kept the same meta_type but have given it a
  different portal_type, you will need to change the condition
  accordingly.  Includes upgrade step.
  Fixes https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneGlossary/issues/3

- Removed use of linkOpaque.gif. It failed in Plone 4.3 and was not
  actually needed.
