"The reception module of Lino-Welfare is for managing a reception desk and"
" a waiting queue. Visitors are \"checked in\" as they present themselves "
"at a reception desk (Empfangsschalter), and \"checked out\" when they "
"leave again. Social assistants then have a possibility to see how many "
"and which clients are waiting for them."

"A **reception clerk** is the user at the reception desk who welcomes "
"visitors. In the public demo database there is a user \"theresia\" with "

"Visitors must have a :ref:`welfare.pcsw.Client` account (technically a "

"Most visitors come at the open consultation hours. and don't have an "
"appointment with some user. In that case the reception clerk clicks "
"\"Create Appointment\". Lino suggests the Client's primary coach as user "
