    """
    Whether unit tests should try to really connect to the cbss.
    Some test cases of the test suite would fail with a timeout if run 
    from behind an IP address that is not registered at the :term:`CBSS`.
    These tests are skipped by default. To activate them, 
    set `cbss_live_tests` to `True` in your :xfile:`settings.py`.
    
    """
    
    #~ cbss_environment = None
    cbss_environment = 'test'
    """
    Either `None` or one of 'test', 'acpt' or 'prod'.
    See :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.cbss.models`.
    Leaving this to `None` means that the cbss module is "inactive" even if installed.
