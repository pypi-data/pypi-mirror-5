Description: 
        This package can be considered the /etc/rc.d of the cloud!
        
        This libary helps users bootstrap many dependent VMs in a cloud (or many clouds).  Services are associated with
        virtual machine images in a cloud and then organized into levels.  Each level is booted in order.  Booting a level
        means launching and configuring all of the VMs needed for each service in the level to run.  Once level 1 is
        booted and ready to go, booting begins on level 2.
