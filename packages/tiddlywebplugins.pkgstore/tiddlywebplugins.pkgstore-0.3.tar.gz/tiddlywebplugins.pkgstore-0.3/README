Read and write tiddlers, bags, and recipes to a package's resources.

For use with `TiddlyWeb <http://tiddlyweb.com>`_ plugins which need
to have access to a predefined set of bags, recipes and tiddlers.

The store is a slightly modified version of the default text store which
can be accessed read+write to build the resources during development,
or read only to use the resources during instance creation or other
situations.
