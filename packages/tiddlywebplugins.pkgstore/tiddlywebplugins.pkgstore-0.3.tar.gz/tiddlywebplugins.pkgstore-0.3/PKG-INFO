Description: Read and write tiddlers, bags, and recipes to a package's resources.
        
        For use with `TiddlyWeb <http://tiddlyweb.com>`_ plugins which need
        to have access to a predefined set of bags, recipes and tiddlers.
        
        The store is a slightly modified version of the default text store which
        can be accessed read+write to build the resources during development,
        or read only to use the resources during instance creation or other
        situations.
