Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        `formatter` is a Python formatter based on the `tokenize` library in Python.
        Due to a bug with line continuations we are currently running a fork of the
        `tokenize` library however.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        To install simply execute `python setup.py install` or `pip install
        formatter`.
        If you want to run the tests first, run `python setup.py nosetests`
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To format all of your code recursively (MAKE BACKUPS!):
        
            formatter -r DIRECTORY
