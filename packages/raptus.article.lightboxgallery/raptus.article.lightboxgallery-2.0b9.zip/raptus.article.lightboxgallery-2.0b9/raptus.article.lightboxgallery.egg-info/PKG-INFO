        Installation
        ============
        
        To install raptus.article.lightboxgallery into your Plone instance, locate the file
        buildout.cfg in the root of your Plone instance directory on the file system,
        and open it in a text editor.
        
        Add the actual raptus.article.lightboxgallery add-on to the "eggs" section of
        buildout.cfg. Look for the section that looks like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
        
        This section might have additional lines if you have other add-ons already
        installed. Just add the raptus.article.lightboxgallery on a separate line, like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                raptus.article.lightboxgallery
        
        Note that you have to run buildout like this::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Then go to the "Add-ons" control panel in Plone as an administrator, and
        install or reinstall the "raptus.article.default" product.
        
        Note that if you do not use the raptus.article.default package you have to
        include the zcml of raptus.article.lightboxgallery either by adding it
        to the zcml list in your buildout or by including it in another package's
        configure.zcml.
