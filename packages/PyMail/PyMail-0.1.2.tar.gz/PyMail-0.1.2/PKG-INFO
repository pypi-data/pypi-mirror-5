Description: PyMail
        ======
        
        PyMail is a simple `SMTP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol>`_ server capable of handling the most
        usual scenarios in local domains. The aim is to have a feature-complete mail solution with minimal demands on system
        performance.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Linux, Unix Systems
        -------------------
        
        System requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Python 2.7 or later
        * C/C++ compiler (if *eventlet* package is not already integrated)
        
        From pip
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        If you have *pip* installed, just type::
        
           pip install PyMail
        
        Similarly, if you have *easy_install*, it would be::
        
           easy_install PyMail
        
        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In the package directory there is a directoy ``etc`` containing a file ``pymail``. You can take this as a starting point for
        your configuration. Copy this file to ``/etc`` and edit it to your needs. Putting it into ``/etc`` has the advantage of not
        having to specify the path on the command line when starting pymail. See the file ``doc/configuration.rst`` for a guide.
        
        Finding the package directory
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The pymail package is installed in directory ``site-packages`` of your Python environment. If you have difficulties finding the
        ``site-packages`` directory you can do as follows::
        
           $ python
           Python 2.7.3 (default, May  5 2013, 17:16:24)
           [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
           Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
           >>> import sys
           >>> print '\n'.join(sys.path)
        
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/beautifulsoup4-4.1.3-py2.7.egg
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/teleboy-0.2-py2.7.egg
           /usr/lib64/python27.zip
           /usr/lib64/python2.7
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/plat-linux2
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-tk
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-old
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-dynload
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/gtk-2.0
           /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode
           /usr/lib64/portage/pym
           >>>
        
        The line ending in ``site-packages`` contains the path of the directory where pymail is installed.
        
        Installing from source on bitbucket.org
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Either clone the project with Mercurial::
        
            $ hg clone https://JohnnyWezel@bitbucket.org/JohnnyWezel/pymail
            
        or download the source as a compressed tar file from the project site (https://bitbucket.org/JohnnyWezel/pymail) and then type::
        
            $ ./setup.py install
        
        You probably first want to prepare a `virtual environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs.html>`_.
