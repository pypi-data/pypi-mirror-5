WAVE is an accessibility analyzing service and Firefox add-on created by
WebAIM. This library provides a few Robot Framework resources for executing
automated analyzes with the Firefox add-on.

pre-installed. The WAVE toolbar, its interface elements, design elements,
functionality, and underlying code are (c) WebAIM.)
