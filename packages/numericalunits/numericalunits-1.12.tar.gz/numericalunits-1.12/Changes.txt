version 1.01, 2012-07-09 -- edited README

version 1.1, 2013-02-20 -- reset_units() runs on first import, and corresponding
changes to documentation. Also, don't mess up the random number generator
state, in case something else is using it. Added units pW, fF, aF.

included).

version 1.12, 2013-06-22 -- fix packaging (remove UTF-8 BOM in .py files,
which seem to cause pip errors in python 3)
