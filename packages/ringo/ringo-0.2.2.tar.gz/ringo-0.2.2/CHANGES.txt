- Added search in overviews
- #15: Implement Search

0.2.2

- Some improvement in Layout. Make header more compact to not waste to much
  space
- Create an empty "forms" dir under views for the basic scaffold. Fixes error
  on creating the form.xml files when adding a new modul.
- Improved add_<<app>>_modul command. Fixed modul (re) initialisation. It the
  modul initialisation does not happen on recreating again the database.
- Fix get_path function. Path is now relativ to the application (was relativ
  to Ringo)
- #10: Add "visible" flag to moduls. Moduls can now be configured in which
  menu to display the modul. (DB change!)
- Added new field "clazzpath" to the modul. Needed only internal for dynmic
  imports on permission checks. (DB change!)
- Need formbar in version > 0.1 to be able to render selection fields.
