Development

Search:

  file which is used to configure various aspects to the rendering of the
  overview tables. This new configuration directive will replace to old
  _table_fields configuration attribute.
- #26: Expand values of relations in the overview from form configuration.
- #27: Save current sorting in the session.
- #28: Save sorting together with the search query in the saved searches.

i18n Support:
- #23: I18n Support in renderes. Added more translations.
- Added lingua as requirement. Needed for message extraction for i18n Support
- Marked form configurations as translateable.
- Added support for translating forms. Requires formbar >= 0.2.1
- Added support to translate headers in the overview.

Misc:
- #19: Login should be in a Popup window

  space
