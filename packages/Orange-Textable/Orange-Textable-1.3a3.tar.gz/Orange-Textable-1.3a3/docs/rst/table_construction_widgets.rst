Table construction widgets
==========================

Widgets of this category take *Segmentation* data in input and emit *Table*
data. They are thus ultimately responsible for converting text to tables,
either by counting items (:doc:`Count <count>`), by measuring their length
(:doc:`Length <length>`), by quantifying their diversity
(:doc:`Variety <variety>`), or by exploiting the annotations associated with
them (:doc:`Annotation <annotation>`). Finally, :doc:`Context <context>` makes
it possible to build concordances and collocation lists.
