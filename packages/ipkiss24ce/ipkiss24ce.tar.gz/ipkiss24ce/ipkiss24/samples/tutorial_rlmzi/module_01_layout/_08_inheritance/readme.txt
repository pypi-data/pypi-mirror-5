Example: Inheritance

In this example we use inheritance to make a special variant of our ring resonator. By using python subclassing, we only need to define the things that have changed with respect to our original ring.  

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- how parameters are inherited, but new parameters can be added
- how the Python super() opbject is used to invoke the methods of the parent 
- how the subclassed component is also recognized as a ring resonator
