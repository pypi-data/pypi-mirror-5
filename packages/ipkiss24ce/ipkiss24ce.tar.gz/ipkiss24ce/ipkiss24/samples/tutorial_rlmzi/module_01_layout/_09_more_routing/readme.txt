Example: Inheritance

In this example we use routing to do more than just link two components together. We define a directional coupler consisting of two routes that are close together. 

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- how a manual route can be created
- how RouteToAngle makes it easy to define a route for a bend
- how RouteConnectorRounded will generate a rounded path
- that routes also contain a port with a wavegudie definition
- how inheritance can be used for more functionality.
