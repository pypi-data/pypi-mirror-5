Example: Structure

In this example we define a parametric cell for a ring resonator.
The parametric cell is defined in 'ring.py'.

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line

This example illustrates
- how to create a parametric cell, by subclassing from Structure
- how to add paremeters as properties
- how to validate properties
- how each instance has a unique name
