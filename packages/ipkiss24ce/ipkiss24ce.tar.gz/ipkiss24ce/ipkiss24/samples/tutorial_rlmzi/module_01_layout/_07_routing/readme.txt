Example: Routing

In this example link the two rings in together using an automated routing component: RouteManhattan. By selecting the right ports, and making sure the rings are sufficiently spaced, a waveguide connects the output of the first ring to the input of the second.  

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- how to calculate an automatic RouteManhatten route
- how to add the route to the layout
