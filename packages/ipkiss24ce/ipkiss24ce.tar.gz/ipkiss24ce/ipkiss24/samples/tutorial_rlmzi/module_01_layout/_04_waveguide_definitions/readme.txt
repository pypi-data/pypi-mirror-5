Example: Waveguide Definition

In this example we use a 'Waveguide Definition'. This is in essence a list of windows that should be drawn on a mask to generate a specific waveguide cross section. A waveguide definition can be drawn along a shape. By using waveguide definitions, the user should not think himself of all the layers he needs to draw on, but only on the shape of the waveguide. 

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- how to use waveguide definitions as parameters in a Structure
- how to draw the waveguide definition along a shape
- that the waveguide width can be looked up in the waveguide definition
