Example: Hierarchy

In this example we group two ring components together in a third component. The rings components can be defined seperately and placed as a reference in the third component. This way, we can partition our design into manageable and reusable blocks.  

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- how to add subcomponents as paremeters to a Structure class
- how to place subcomponents in a layout using SRef
- the use of transformations (Translation and VMirror)
- how to use the ports of the subcomponents to define the ports of the main component
