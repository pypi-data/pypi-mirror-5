Example: Technology

In this example we introduce the TECH object: a storage space for default settings associated with a particular fabrication technology of a fab. 

The example builds on the same code 'ring.py', but adds default values derived from the TECH Tree.

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- the use of the TECH object to set default values
- the selection of the technology (in 'execute.py')
- the fact that technology should be loaded as the first line of the executable
