Example: Simple Layout

In this example we generate our first layout, for the ring resonator defined in the previous examples. 

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- how to add a 'define_elements' to define a layout
- how shapes can be defined with manual coordinates, or with predefined functions
- how shapes can be assigned to a Path on a specific layer
- how a Structure can be quickly written to a GDSII file with a shorthand
- how to create a library and save this to a GDSII file
