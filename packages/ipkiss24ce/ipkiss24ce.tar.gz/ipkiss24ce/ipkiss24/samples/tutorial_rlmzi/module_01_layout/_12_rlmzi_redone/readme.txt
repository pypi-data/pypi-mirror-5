Example: A better Ring Loaded Mach Zehnder

In this example, we build further on the generic MZI classes from the previous example. We create a MZI which can have another Structure in each arm. A special case of this is a Ring-Loaded MZI, but we find our class is so useful right away that it is not very necessary to define a specific RL MZI class

To run the example, run 'execute.py' from the command line.

This example illustrates
- The use of inheritance, and careful design of the class hierarchy
- the use of the define methods
- that there are multiple ways to use the classes
