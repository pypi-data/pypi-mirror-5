This series of examples starts you with IPKISS from scratch
- defining a basic component
- the use of parameters
- generating layout and saving to GDSII
- Input and output ports
- Waveguide definition
- The use of hierarchy in a layout
- Routing waveguides
- Inheritance for efficient code reuse

and it culminates in the definition of a ring-loaded Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which will be used in other modules to illustrate physical and circuit simulations.
