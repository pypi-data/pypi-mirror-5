PyPDFOCR
========

This program will help manage your scanned PDFs for you. It can do the
following:

-  Take a scanned PDF file and run OCR on it (using free OCR tools),
   generating a searchable PDF
-  Optionally, watch a folder for incoming scanned PDFs and
   automatically run OCR on them
-  Optionally, file the scanned PDFs into directories based on simple
   keyword matching that you specify
-  *Coming soon*: Evernote auto-upload and filing

Usage:
------

Single conversion:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pypdfocr filename.pdf

    --> filename_ocr.pdf will be generated

Folder monitoring:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pypdfocr -w watch_directory

    --> Every time a pdf file is added to `watch_directory` it will be OCR'ed

Automatic filing (new!):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To automatically move the OCR'ed pdf to a directory based on a keyword,
use the -f option and specify a configuration file (described below):

::

    pypdfocr filename.pdf -f -c config.yaml

You can also do this in folder monitoring mode:

::

    pypdfocr -w watch_directory -f -c config.yaml

Configuration file for automatic PDF filing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The config.yaml file above is a simple folder to keyword matching text
file. It determines where your OCR'ed PDFs (and optionally, the original
scanned PDF) are placed after processing. An example is given below:

::

    target_folder: "docs/filed"
    default_folder: "docs/filed/manual_sort"
    original_move_folder: "docs/originals"

    folders:
        finances:
            - american express
            - chase card
            - internal revenue service
        travel:
            - boarding pass
            - airlines
            - expedia
            - orbitz
        receipts:
            - receipt

The ``target_folder`` is the root of your filing cabinet. Any PDF moving
will happen in sub-directories under this directory.

The ``folders`` section defines your filing directories and the keywords
associated with them. In this example, we have three filing directories
(finances, travl, receipts), and some associated keywords for each
filing directory. For example, if your OCR'ed PDF contains the phrase
"american express" (in any upper/lower case), it will be filed into
``docs/filed/finances``

The ``default_folder`` is where the OCR'ed PDF is moved to if there is
no keyword match.

The ``original_move_folder`` is optional (you can comment it out with
``#`` in front of that line), but if specified, the original scanned PDF
is moved into this directory after OCR is done. Otherwise, if this field
is not present or commented out, your original PDF will stay where it
was found.

If there is any naming conflict during filing, the program will add an
underscore followed by a number to each filename, in order to avoid
overwriting files that may already be present.

Caveats
-------

This code is brand-new, and is barely commented with no unit-tests
included. I plan to improve things as time allows in the near-future.
Sphinx code generation is on my TODO list.

Installation
------------

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

PyPDFOCR is available in PyPI, so you can just run:

::

    pip install pypdfocr

You will also need to install the external dependencies listed below.
For those on **Windows**, because it's such a pain to get all the PIL
and PDF dependencies installed, I've gone ahead and made an executable
called
`pypdfocr.exe <https://github.com/virantha/pypdfocr/blob/master/dist/pypdfocr.exe?raw=true>`__

You still need to install Tesseract and GhostScript as detailed below in
the dependencies list.

Manual install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the source directly from github (you need to have git installed):

::

    git clone https://github.com/virantha/pypdfocr.git

Then, install the following third-party python libraries: - PIL (Python
Imaging Library) http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ - ReportLab
(PDF generation library) http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/ -
Watchdog (Cross-platform fhlesystem events monitoring)
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog - PyPDF2 (Pure python pdf library)

These can all be installed via pip:

::

    pip install pil
    pip install reportlab
    pip install watchdog
    pip install pypdf2

You will also need to install the external dependencies listed below.

External Dependencies:
----------------------

PyPDFOCR relies on the following (free) programs being installed and in
the path:

-  Tesseract OCR software https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/
-  GhostScript http://www.ghostscript.com/

On Mac OS X, you can install these using homebrew:

::

    brew install tesseract
    brew install ghostscript
