PyPDFOCR
========

This script will take a pdf file and generate the corresponding OCR'ed
version.

Usage:
------

Single conversion:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    python pypdfocr.py filename.pdf

    --> filename_ocr.pdf will be generated

Folder monitoring (new!):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    python pypdfocr.py -w watch_directory

    --> Every time a pdf file is added to `watch_directory` it will be OCR'ed

For those on Windows, because it's such a pain to get all the PIL and
PDF dependencies installed, I've gone ahead and made an executable
available under:

::

    dist/pypdfocr.exe

You still need to install Tesseract and GhostScript as detailed below in
the dependencies list.

Caveats
-------

This code is brand-new, and is barely commented with no unit-tests
included. I plan to improve things as time allows in the near-future.

Dependencies:
-------------

PyPDFOCR relies on the following (free) programs being installed and in
the path:

-  Tesseract OCR software https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/
-  GhostScript http://www.ghostscript.com/
-  PIL (Python Imaging Library) http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
-  ReportLab (PDF generation library)
   http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/
-  Watchdog (Cross-platform fhlesystem events monitoring)
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog

On Mac OS X, you can install the first two using homebrew:

::

    brew install tesseract
    brew install ghostscript

The last three can be installed using a regular python manager such as
pip:

::

    pip install pil
    pip install reportlab
    pip install watchdog
