Description: Grid Map
        -----------
        
        A module to allow you to easily create jobs on the cluster directly from
        Python. You can directly map Python functions onto the cluster without
        needing to write any wrapper code yourself.
        
        This is the ETS fork of an older project called Python Grid. It's a lot
        simpler than the original version, because we use a Redis database for
        storing the inputs/outputs for each job instead of the ZeroMQ-based
        method they were using. The main benefit of this approach is you never
        run into issues with exceeding the message length when you're
        parallelizing a huge job.
        
        For some examples of how to use it, check out map\_reduce.py
        (for a simple example of how you can map a function onto the cluster)
        and manual.py (for an example of how you can create list of
        jobs yourself) in the examples folder.

        *NOTE*: You cannot use Grid Map on a machine that is not allowed to
        submit jobs (e.g., slave nodes).
