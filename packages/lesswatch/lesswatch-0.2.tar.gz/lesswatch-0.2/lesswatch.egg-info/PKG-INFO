Description: # lesswatch
        
        Watches LESS files, and automatically compiles them when they
        are changed.
        
        ## Usage
        
            $ lesswatch <DIR>
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install lesswatch
            
        or
        
            git clone https://github.com/jkeyes/lesswatch.git
            cd lesswatch
            python setup.py install
        
        ## External Dependencies
        
        lesswatch used the [lessc compiler](http://lesscss.org/#guide)
        and it must be on the PATH.
        
        First you need to download and install node.js. Download the latest 
        stable version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download) and 
        extract the contents from the archive: `tar xf node-v0.4.12.tar.gz`.
        
        Then:
        
            $ cd node-v0.4.12
            $ ./configure
            $ make
            $ make install
        
        Then you need to install LESS:
        
            $ npm install -g less
        
        Try `lessc` to see if this was successful:
        
            $ which lessc
            /usr/bin/lessc
            $ echo "body  {  color:  red; }"  > test.less
            $ lessc test.less
            body {
              color: red;
            }
