Description: PNW
        ===
        
        pnw is a text processing tool with a wide range of applications. It can
        be used to compile chunks of text from various sources into a new text
        file. The advantage over cut-and-paste techniques is that changes in the
        source file are automatically followed. Secondly, we provide a thin
        wrapper around the pandoc document converter. Therefore, chunks of text
        can be converted from and to a wide range of lightweight markup
        languages as well as html and tex/latex. Although literate programming
        has become a little out of fashion, pnw can be used as a literate
        programming tool, too. Not surprisingly, pnw itself and its
        documentation is written using pnw. pnw is remotely inspired by noweb
        and heavily inspired by (even borrowing part of the syntax from)
        `antiweb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/antiweb/0.2.2>`_. An important
        feature of pnw, which is not present in antiweb, is the support of
        namespaces. This allows to create reusable *block libraries* which can
        be imported and addressed in a *dot-notation syntax* similar to python
        modules.
        
        A pnw file is a text file with tags defining named blocks of text. In a
        way this is similar to an xml file. Tags may be hidden behind comment
        characters, such that the file remains processable by another program.
        The blocks of text from various pnw files can be processed and rendered
        by another pnw file.
        
        
        Nutshell
        --------
        
        Here is a brief example of a pnw file::
        
            
            $@path(../..)
            $@path(..)
            $@import(latex-blocks.tex)
            $@import(md-blocks)
            $@import(pnw.pnw)
            $@include(ltxheader)
            $@chunk(test,format=md)
            
               A block of text
            $@end
        
            $@chunk(pnw,format=rst)
            PNW
            ===
        
            $@include(moduledoc)
            $@include(test)
            $@end
