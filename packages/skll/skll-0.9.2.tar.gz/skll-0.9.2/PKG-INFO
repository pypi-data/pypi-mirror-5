Description: SciKit-Learn Laboratory
        -----------------------
        
        This package provides a number of utilities to make it simpler to run
        common scikit-learn experiments with pre-generated features.
        
        Command-line Interface
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``run_experiment`` is a command-line utility for running a series of
        learners on datasets specified in a configuration file. For more
        information about using run_experiment (including a quick example),
        go `here <https://scikit-learn-laboratory.readthedocs.org/en/latest/run_experiment.html>`__.
        
        Python API
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you just want to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate learning code,
        you can use our simple well-documented Python API. The main way you'll
        want to use the API is through the ``load_examples`` function and the
        ``Learner`` class. For more details on how to simply train, test,
        cross-validate, and run grid search on a variety of scikit-learn models
        see `the documentation <https://scikit-learn-laboratory.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__.
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Python 2.7+
        -  `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__
        -  `six <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`__
        -  `PrettyTable <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PrettyTable>`__
        -  `Grid Map <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gridmap>`__ (only required if you plan
           to run things in parallel on a DRMAA-compatible cluster)
        
        Changelog
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        
        -  v0.9.2
        
           +  Fixed example.cfg path issue. Updated some documentation.
           +  Made path in make_example_iris_data.py consistent with the updated one
              in example.cfg
        
        -  v0.9.1
        
           +  Fixed bug where classification experiments would raise an error about class
              labels not being floats
           +  Updated documentation to include quick example for run_experiment.
