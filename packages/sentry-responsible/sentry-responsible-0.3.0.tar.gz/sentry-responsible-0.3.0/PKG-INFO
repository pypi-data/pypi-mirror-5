        ==================
        
        sentry-responsible is an extension to Sentry which lets you assign
        responsibilities for events.
        
        This extension adds a widget on the sidebar of a event page to mark
        team members as being responsible for a event. When working in teams
        where everyone has an eye on incoming events that information might
        save you some time by recognizing that someone else is already
        investigating this issue (if not, then you are the lucky one).
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install the extension run::
        
          pip install sentry-responsible
        
        Then restart your Sentry server to activate the plugin.
