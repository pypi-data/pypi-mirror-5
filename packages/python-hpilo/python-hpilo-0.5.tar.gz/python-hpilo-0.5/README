Accessing HP iLO interfaces from python
=======================================

This module will make it easy for you to access the Integrated Lights Out
management interface of your HP hardware. It supports iLO, iLO 2 and iLO 3 and
It uses the XML interface to access and change the iLO.

HP, Integrated Lights out and iLO are trademarks of HP, with whom the author of
this software is not affiliated in any way other than using some of their
hardware.

Installing
----------

The software is easy to install from github:

$ git clone git://github.com/seveas/python-hpilo
$ cd python-hpilo
$ python setup.py install

The minimum python version supported is 2.5 as this software uses the
ElementTree XML library. It is probably possible to use older versions and an
external ElementTree library, but this is left as an exercise to the reader.

Usage
-----
See docs/*.rst or the documentation on http://packages.python.org/python-hpilo/
for API documentation and examples.
