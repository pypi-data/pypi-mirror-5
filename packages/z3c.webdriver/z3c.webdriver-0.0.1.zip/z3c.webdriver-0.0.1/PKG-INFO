Description: z3c.webdriver
        =============
        
        This package provides tools and wrappers around ``selenium.webdriver``.
        
        We specially care about ``selenium.webdriver.PhantomJS``, because:
        
          - it's easy to deploy, it's a single executable, ``gp.recipe.phantomjs`` works
          - it's built on ``webkit``
          - it can be debugged with a ``Chromium`` / ``Chrome`` browser, incl. breakpoints
        
        Things to watch out for:
        
          - any single instance of PhantomJS acts as a single browser instance
            that means cookies and whatnot are *shared* if you intantiate more
            browsers for a single driver.
            Workaround could be to start more drivers.
          - the headless browser is truly ``async``, that means an AJAX click does NOT
            wait for the AJAX request to complete, you explicitely need to wait for it
          - any single call to PhantomJS via selenium takes TIME
          - zope.testbrowser supporting methods like ``getControl`` are slow now
          - there are 2 options for setUp/tearDown, either the driver is started and torn
            down with the layer or with each test. Starting and stopping takes around
            1.5-2 secs, so you decide whether you need separation or speed.
