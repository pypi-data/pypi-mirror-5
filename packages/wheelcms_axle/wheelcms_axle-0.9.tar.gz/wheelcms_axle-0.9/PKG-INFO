Description: WheelCMS Axle
        =============
        
        This is the 'core' package for WheelCMS. It provides the base implementation
        for the content types (spokes), the database tree structure (nodes), search
        indexing, userena integration and request handling/dispatching.
        
        It's called Axle, because that's the center of a Wheel :)
