CommPy
======

CommPy is an open source toolkit implementing digital communications algorithms 
in Python using SciPy, NumPy and Cython.

Objectives
----------
- To provide readable and useable implementations of algorithms used in the research, design and implementation of digital communication systems.

FAQs
----
Why are you developing this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During my coursework in communication theory and systems at UCSD, I realized that the best way to actually learn and understand the theory is to try and implement ''the Math'' in practice :). Having used Scipy before, I thought there should be a similar package for Digital Communications in Python. This is a start!

What programming languages do you use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CommPy uses Python as its base programming language and python packages like NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib. Some algorithms which are too slow in a pure Python implementation are implemented using Cython.

How can I contribute?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implement any feature you want and send me a pull request :). If you want to suggest new features or discuss anything related to CommPy, please get in touch with me (veeresht@gmail.com).

How do I use CommPy?
