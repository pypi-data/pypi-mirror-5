comments: 1

<p>Add a document header field <code>comments</code> and give it a value to enable comments for a document:</p>
<pre>comments: 1</pre>
<p>If you don't want comments on particular posts just omit the <code>comments</code> header field or don't give it a value:</p>
<pre>comments:</pre>

<p>In the document's template check for the value of the <code>comments</code> field and add the code for an external comment systems like Disqus or Facebook comments:</p>
<pre>
{% if comments %}
    comments go here
{% endif %}
</pre>
<p>The above code checks that the <code>comments</code> variable exists and has a value, so this will also show the comments section if you enter a value of 0 in the document header.</p>
