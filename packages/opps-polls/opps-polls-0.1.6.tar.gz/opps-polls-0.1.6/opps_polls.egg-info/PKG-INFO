        )
        ```
        
        **URL**
        
        Include in your project urls.py before the opps entry
        
        ```python
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            ...
            ...
            url(r'^poll/', include('opps.polls.urls', namespace='polls', app_name='polls')),
            ...
            url(r'^', include('opps.urls')),
            ...
            ...
        )
        ```
        
        Create the tables
        
        ```python
        python manage.py syncdb
        ```
        You should see:
        
        ```
        ...
        Creating table polls_poll
        Creating table polls_pollpost
        Creating table polls_choice
        ...
        ```
        
        Now **opps.polls** is available on your Django admin and you can access the url *http://..../poll/*
        
        Application URLs
        ----------------
        
        *    List all polls
             /poll/
        *    List all polls by channel
             /poll/channel/< channel-slug >
        *    Poll voting page
             /poll/< poll-slug >
        *    Poll results page
             /poll/< poll-slug >/results (you can use any word here i.e: /poll/< poll-slug >/resultados)
        
        Application Templates
        ---------------
        
        For any template the context has the following objects:
        
        * poll (The poll)
        * voted (The choices when the user has voted)
        * error (A string message when there is some error)
        
        **Default template files**
        
        * polls/pool_list.html (List all polls)
        * polls/pool_detail.html (Show details and voting form)
        * polls/pool_voted.html (Showed after the user has voted)
        * polls/pool_result.html (Results percentage)
        * polls/pool_closed.html (Showed when poll is not opened for voting or results)
        
        
        **Custom template files**
        
        polls will try to find the most specific template to render.
        You can choose some ways to force a custom template
        In order of precedence:
        
        1. Set **template_path** in each poll object
        2. Create a **polls/< channel-slug >/< poll-slug >_<sufix>.html**
        3. Create a **polls/< channel-slug >_< sufix >.html**
        4. Create a **polls/< poll-slug >_< sufix >.html**
        5. Create a **polls/poll_< sufix >.html**
        
        Available sufix are: list, detail, voted, result, closed
