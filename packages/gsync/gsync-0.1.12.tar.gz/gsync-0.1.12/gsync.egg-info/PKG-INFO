        Google currently don't produce a Linux variant of their client for Google-Drive.
        This is my implementation of a multiplatform, command line tool that for the
        most part, is intended to behave much like rsync.  I aim to follow the same
        functional implementation of rsync and also provide the same features, enabled
        or disabled through a similar interface of command line options.
        
        There was a close contender for being a suitable client called grive.  This is
        ideal if you only intend to sync a small library of files or if the files being
        synchronised are small in size.  I found the client to be unreliable in other
        cases, crashing and failing to synchronise very little.  I looked over much of
        the code and found that it favours preloading with a hash of the directory to
        be synchronised and all sub directories, before it even synchronises any files.
        This creates a scenario where synchronisation will never take place if the
        preloading fails.  Instead, I will opt to process directories depth first and
        sequentially in order to allow synchronisation to occur immediately.
        
        The only prerequisite is that you have python.  The makefile will take care of
        installing any required python libraries using pip, which will also be obtained.

        Installation:
        ===============================================================================
        
        The GSync package is now available on pypi.python.org.  It can be installed
        using pip.  I recommend using pip over easy_install or pypi-install, since pip
        takes care of dependencies through setuptools.  I have found that easy_install
        only checks for dependencies but doesn't actually install them.  On Debian I
        installed using the following steps:
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
            $ sudo easy_install pip
            $ sudo pip install gsync
        
        To upgrade gsync, you can run pip with the --upgrade option:
        
            $ sudo pip install --upgrade gsync
        
        That's it.  GSync will be installed along with any required packages.
        
        RSync options implemented so far:
        ===============================================================================
        
         -v, --verbose               enable verbose output
             --debug                 enable debug output
         -q, --quiet                 suppress non-error messages
         -c, --checksum              skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size
         -r, --recursive             recurse into directories
         -R, --relative              use relative path names
         -u, --update                skip files that are newer on the receiver
         -d, --dirs                  transfer directories without recursing
         -g, --group                 preserve group
         -o, --owner                 preserve owner (super-user only)
         -p, --perms                 preserve permissions
         -i, --itemize-changes       output a change-summary for all updates
             --progress              show progress during transfer
