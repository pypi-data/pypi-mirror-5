Introduction

What It Does
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Crochet provides the following features:

* Runs Twisted's reactor in a thread it manages.
* The reactor shuts down automatically when the process' main thread finishes.
* Hooks up Twisted's log system to the Python standard library ``logging``
  framework. Unlike Twisted's built-in ``logging`` bridge, this includes
  support for blocking `Handler` instances.
* Provides a blocking API to eventual results (i.e. ``Deferred``
  instances). This last feature can be used separately, so Crochet is also
  useful for normal Twisted applications that use threads.

Why should you care about using Twisted? Because it gives you the full power
of an event-driven networking framework from inside your applications.


Example: Background Scheduling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can use Crochet to schedule events that will run in the background
without slowing down the page rendering of your web applications:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/scheduling.py


Example: SSH into your Server:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can SSH into your Python process and get a Python prompt, allowing you to
poke around in the internals of your running program:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/ssh.py


Example: DNS Query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Twisted also has a fully featured DNS library:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/mxquery.py
