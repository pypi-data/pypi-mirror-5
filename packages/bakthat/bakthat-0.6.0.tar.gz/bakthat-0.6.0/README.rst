Bakthat
=======

Bakthat is a MIT licensed backup framework written in Python, it's both a command line tool and a Python module that helps you manage backups on Amazon `S3 <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_/`Glacier <http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/>`_ and OpenStack `Swift <http://swift.openstack.org>`_. It automatically compress, encrypt (symmetric encryption) and upload your files.

Here are some features:

* Compress with `tarfile <http://docs.python.org/library/tarfile.html>`_
* Encrypt with `beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_ (**optional**)
* Upload/download to S3 or Glacier with `boto <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto>`_
* Local backups inventory stored in a SQLite database with `peewee <http://peewee.readthedocs.org/>`_
* Delete older than, and `Grandfather-father-son backup rotation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme#Grandfather-father-son>`_ supported
* Possibility to sync backups database between multiple clients via a centralized server
* Exclude files using .gitignore like file
* Extendable with plugins

You can restore backups **with** or **without** bakthat, you just have to download the backup, decrypt it with `Beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_ command-line tool and untar it.

Check out `the documentation to get started <http://docs.bakthat.io>`_.
