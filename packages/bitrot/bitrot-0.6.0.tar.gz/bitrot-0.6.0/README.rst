bitrot
======

Detects bit rotten files on the hard drive to save your precious photo
and music collection from slow decay.

Usage
-----

Go to the desired directory and simply invoke::

  $ bitrot

This will start digging through your directory structure recursively
indexing all files found. The index is stored in a ``.bitrot.db`` file
which is a SQLite 3 database.

Next time you run ``bitrot`` it will add new files and update the index
for files with a changed modification date. Most importantly however, it
will report all errors, e.g. files that changed on the hard drive but
still have the same modification date.

All paths stored in ``.bitrot.db`` are relative so it's safe to rescan
a folder after moving it to another drive.

Performance
-----------

Obviously depends on how fast the underlying drive is. No rigorous
performance tests have been done. For informational purposes, a typical
5400 RPM laptop hard drive scanning a 60+ GB music library takes around
15 minutes. On an OCZ Vertex 3 SSD drive ``bitrot`` is able to scan
a 100 GB Aperture library in under 10 minutes. Both tests on HFS+.

Change Log
----------

0.6.0
~~~~~

* more control over performance with ``--commit-interval`` and
  ``--chunk-size`` command-line arguments

* bugfix: symbolic links are now properly skipped (or can be followed if
  ``--follow-links`` is passed)

* bugfix: files that cannot be opened are now gracefully skipped

* bugfix: fixed a rare division by zero when run in an empty directory

0.5.1
~~~~~

* bugfix: warn about test mode only in test mode

0.5.0
~~~~~

* ``--test`` command-line argument for testing the state without
  updating the database on disk (works for testing databases you don't
  have write access to)

* size of the data read is reported upon finish

* minor performance updates

0.4.0
~~~~~

* renames are now reported as such

* all non-regular files (e.g. symbolic links, pipes, sockets) are now
  skipped

* progress presented in percentage

0.3.0
~~~~~

* ``--sum`` command-line argument for easy comparison of multiple
  databases

0.2.1
~~~~~

* fixed regression from 0.2.0 where new files caused a ``KeyError``
  exception

0.2.0
~~~~~

* ``--verbose`` and ``--quiet`` command-line arguments

* if a file is no longer there, its entry is removed from the database

0.1.0
