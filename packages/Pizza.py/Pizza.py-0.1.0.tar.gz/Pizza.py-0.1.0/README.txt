About
=====
This version of Pizza.py was forked from the repository at https://github.com/slitvinov/Pizza.py by Craig Finch on 11 Nov 2013. I am not affiliated with Steve Plimpton or Department of Energy.  I modified Pizza.py so that it can be installed in the standard manner setuptools. I recognize that this may break the parts of Pizza.py that modify operation of the Python command-line interpreter. Please contribute improvements to this repo! 

Pizza.py is a loosely integrated collection of tools written in Python, many of which provide pre- and post-processing capability for the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package.  There are tools to create input files, convert between file formats, process log and dump files, create plots, and visualize and animate simulation snapshots.

Pizza.py was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).
