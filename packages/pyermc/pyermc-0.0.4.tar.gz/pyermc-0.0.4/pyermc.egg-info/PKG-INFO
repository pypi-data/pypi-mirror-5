Description: pyermc is a memcache client library with support for "pluggable"
        driver backends.
        
        Current backends include a text protocol driver (default), a binary
        protocol driver, and a wrapped ultramemcached driver.
        
        While pyermc is somewhat compatible with python-memcached, full
        compatibility is not a design goal.
        
        pyermc supports connecting to a single memcached instance (or server
        that speaks the memcached protocol). If you require multiple servers,
        consistent hashing, etc, then it is recommended to use twemproxy or
        similar.
        
        pyermc exposes connectivity faults, via exceptions, to the calling
        code. This is in contrast to python-memcached, which simply enters an
        'ignore backend' state. Exposing underlying faults is often needed when
        working with queueing servers that support the memcache driver (such as
        kestrel and darner), as well as translation proxies like couchbase's
        moxie. If the old behavior is desired, there is an optional error_as_miss
        parameter that may be set as part of client creation.
