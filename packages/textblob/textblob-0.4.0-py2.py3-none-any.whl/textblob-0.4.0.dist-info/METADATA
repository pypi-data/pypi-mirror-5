        `TextBlob` is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. It provides a consistent API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and more.

            The titular threat of The Blob has always struck me as the ultimate movie
            monster: an insatiably hungry, amoeba-like mass able to penetrate
            virtually any safeguard, capable of--as a doomed doctor chillingly
            describes it--"assimilating flesh on contact.
            Snide comparisons to gelatin be damned, it's a concept with the most
            devastating of potential consequences, not unlike the grey goo scenario
            proposed by technological theorists fearful of
            artificial intelligence run rampant.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.4.0 (2013-08-05)
        ------------------
        - New ``text.tokenizers`` module with ``WordTokenizer`` and ``SentenceTokenizer``. Tokenizer instances (from either textblob itself or NLTK) can be passed to TextBlob's constructor. Tokens are accessed through the new ``tokens`` property.
        - New ``Blobber`` class for creating TextBlobs that share the same tagger, tokenizer, and np_extractor.
        - Add ``ngrams`` method.
        - `Backwards-incompatible`: ``TextBlob.json()`` is now a method, not a property. This allows you to pass arguments (the same that you would pass to ``json.dumps()``).
        - New home for documentation: https://textblob.readthedocs.org/
        - Add parameter for cleaning HTML markup from text.
        - Minor improvement to word tokenization.
        - Updated NLTK.
        - Fix bug with adding blobs to bytestrings.
        
        0.3.10 (2013-08-02)
        -------------------
        - Bundled NLTK no longer overrides local installation.
        - Fix sentiment analysis of text with non-ascii characters.
        
        0.3.9 (2013-07-31)
        ------------------
        - Updated nltk.
        - ConllExtractor is now Python 3-compatible.
        - Improved sentiment analysis.
        - Blobs are equal (with `==`) to their string counterparts.
        - Added instructions to install textblob without nltk bundled.
        - Dropping official 3.1 and 3.2 support.
        
        0.3.8 (2013-07-30)
        ------------------
        - Importing TextBlob is now **much faster**. This is because the noun phrase parsers are trained only on the first call to ``noun_phrases`` (instead of training them every time you import TextBlob).
        - Add text.taggers module which allows user to change which POS tagger implementation to use. Currently supports PatternTagger and NLTKTagger (NLTKTagger only works with Python 2).
        - NPExtractor and Tagger objects can be passed to TextBlob's constructor.
        - Fix bug with POS-tagger not tagging one-letter words.
        - Rename text/np_extractor.py -> text/np_extractors.py
        - Add run_tests.py script.
        
        0.3.7 (2013-07-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Every word in a ``Blob`` or ``Sentence`` is a ``Word`` instance which has methods for inflection, e.g ``word.pluralize()`` and ``word.singularize()``.
        
        - Updated the ``np_extractor`` module. Now has an new implementation, ``ConllExtractor`` that uses the Conll2000 chunking corpus. Only works on Py2.
