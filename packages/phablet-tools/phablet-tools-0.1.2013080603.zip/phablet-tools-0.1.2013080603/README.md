phablet-tools
=============

Abstract
---------
This is the modified version of phablet-tools based on Augest 06, 2013 version (`phablet-tools_0.15+13.10.20130806`).

The original version is http://ppa.launchpad.net/phablet-team/tools/ubuntu/pool/main/p/phablet-tools/

Phablet-tools is a tool for installing the Ubuntu Touch OS into your mobile devices (Currently, only Nexus S, Nexus 4, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 are supported officially)

Motivation
----------

Now Phablet-tools only can run on the Ubuntu, it is, somehow, inconvenient for guys who can not access Ubuntu, like me, I only can use Windows 7 in my office. 

So I tried to read the source code to find out whether it can be ported to other systems, like Windows. And I found it is made by Python 2.X, and it is almost platform-independent.

I modified a little code in the  phabletutils/environment.py, and setup this repository, I hope it can be helpful for the guys who want to try Ubuntu Touch without Ubuntu System , I know it sounds some-kind weird, ;-).

Requirement
-----------

Because Phablet-tools need some dependencies, you need install them by yourself.

1. Python 2.X, I recommend you to install 2.7, I just test it on 2.7.5.
2. ADB tools (including adb.exe and fastboot.exe, I think it will not be a problem for you)
3. wget and rsync, it need to be installed on Windows, and for Mac, it seems it is out of box. (I am not sure since I installed MacPorts)
4. USB drivers for your device, I believe it will not be another problem for you, just google it.

Remember, all of them need to be added into PATH environment variable.

For Python, it need requests and configobj modules, you can install them use `ez_setup` tools.

Install 
--------
Please refer to this link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install

For Windows Users
-----------------

After you install the Python (Assume you installed it on C:\Python27), we need do something to make you flash your device easier.

Firstly, add the Python install dir (C:\Python27) and scripts dir (C:\Python27\Scripts) to your PATH environment variable.

Second, install `ez_setup` module, please follow this tutorial https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.9.8#windows

Third, run

    easy_install phablet-tools

to install phablet-tools.

After install phablet-tools, you could create the phablet-flash.cmd in the C:\Python27\Scripts directory, the contents like following. This step will make you easy when you following the Install instruction.

    python C:\Python27\Scripts\phablet-flash %1 %2 %3

Fourth, download msys from here http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files

Do not select any options since we do not need them. After installation completed, go to install dir (assume it is C:\MingGW), go to bin dir, and run

    mingw-get install msys-rsync

    mingw-get install msys-wget-bin

And you should add msys dir (maybe C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin) to your PATH variable.

Fifth, download the Android SDK and unzip it, add the dir which contains adb.exe and fastboot.exe to PATH variable.

And now, you can follow the Install above to install Ubuntu Touch to your device.
