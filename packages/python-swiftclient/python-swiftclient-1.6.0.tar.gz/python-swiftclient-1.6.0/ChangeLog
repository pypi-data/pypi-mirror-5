    Reformat help outputs
    
    Reformatted the help outputs in the swift client to bring them more
    in line with the rest of the openstack clients. Changes were added to
    all of the st_command_help variables and a new variable
    st_command_options was added to help with correct formatting of

    Move multi-threading code to a library.
    
    This patch extracts the multi-threading code from bin/swift into
    swiftclient/multithreading and adds tests.  In particular, this new way
    of doing it (with context managers) will prevent non-daemonic threads
    from wedging the process when unexpected exceptions happen.
    
    I enabled reporting of which lines, specifically, are not covered by
    unit tests (added -m option to "coverage report" in .unittests).
    
    This patch includes a drive-by fix for uploading a segmented file with
    --use-slo when that object already exists.  A key of "name" was used
    instead of "path", raising KeyError.
    
    There's also another drive-by fix for uploading segmented objects with
    --use-slo.  Commit 874e0e4427b80e1b15b74a1557b73ba9d61443ca regressed
    this by removing the capturing of thread-worker results in
    QueueFunctionThread.run().  This patch restores that functionality and
    the feature (uploading SLO objects).

    Refuse carriage return in header value
    
    See bug #1188896.
    Comparing with Curl and Django, they both refuse carriage returns in
    header values, so the request() method on the HTTP(S)Connection instance
    returned by swiftclient.client.http_connection() will raise an
    InvalidHeadersException if any of the headers to be sent contain a
    newline.
    
    Drive-by fix for a couple of header values which were integers instead
    of strings (Content-Length getting set to zero).

    Adds max-backoff for retries in Connection.
    
    The max-backoff concept prevents the backoff used in _retry to double infinitely (which in turn causes wait times of an hour or more between retries).
    
    As per review, changed code to use min instead.

Author: Darrell Bishop <darrell@swiftstack.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 28 21:26:54 2013 -0700

    Allow storage url override for both auth vers.
    
    When --os-storage-url is specified on the command-line to bin/swift, it
    will override the used storage URL regardless of authentication for both
    authentication version 1 and version 2.  This can be used to bypass a
    load-balancer to hit a specific proxy server for testing/debugging
    purposes.
    
    Within the client library, this feature is accessed by passing the
    desired storage URL into swiftclient.client.Conection.__init__() via the
    os_options keyword argument.  For example:
    
      conn = Connection(auth_url, user, key, os_options={
        'object_storage_url': 'http://overridden.storage.url/AUTH_foo'})
    
    This patch also adds a dependency on mock>=0.8.0, which is the same as
    openstack/swift.

    Add -p option to download command.
    
    Allow the ability to download a subset of containers (--all with -p) or
    a subset of objects within a container (container name with -p).
    
    This patch also includes a drive-by fix for "download --all" which would
    not actually download any objects (for me, at least) because the object
    queue got filled with "stop" messages before the container workers had
    run long enough to put work in the object queue.  Doh!
    
    I also closed up a few holes where an (unexpected, obviously) Exception
    could cause the process to hang because non-daemon threads still
    existed.

    remove busy-wait so that swift client won't use up all CPU cycles
    
    The current implementation uses busy-wait and checking flags to
    communicate between threads. It wastes a lot of CPU powers. With
    python 2.6 is required for Swift, the communication between
    threads should now be using queue and signal mechanisms. This
    patch removed the busy-wait loops and use queue and queue join
    for threads coordination which will not consume CPU cycles if

    log get_auth request url instead of x-storage-url
    
    because if the request gets a 4xx error, then the url will be None, and that's just confusing.

    Eradicate eventlet and fix bug lp:959221
    
    The bug is simple: whenever swift uploads to a Swift with SSL,
    it uses 100% CPU. It happens because we use HTTPSConnection from
    eventlet that loops like that, while holding the interpreter lock.
    
    Now, it could be fixed in eventlet, but let's try something more
    natural: drop the eventlet's HTTP client. We do not use green
    threads in the client anymore, so it's not like we need it for that.
    
    Note that in most cases clients do not use the BufferedHTTPConnection
    either, because it's only installed on Swift server nodes, not on
    workstations. Get rid of that too.

    Confirm we have auth creds before clearing preauth
    
    If you use the API and supply only preauth values (preauthurl and
    preauthtoken), and if either of these are incorrect, a non-descriptive
    AttributeError will be thrown and uncaught:
    
     'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find'
    
    The _retry() will fail on the first pass (getting 401), then try
    to reauthenticate with non-preauth values. If those are not given,
    particularly the auth url, then the urlparse() call will be supplied
    None for the url in http_connection() causing the exception above.
    
    This change makes sure that we have an auth url, user and key before
    retrying authentication. Given the situation above, a '401 Unauthorized'
    ClientException will now be thrown instead of the AttributeError.

    Allow user to specify headers at the command line.
    
    Currently swift client does not allow content type to be specified
    when upload an object. It does not allow a user to change content
    type neither. This patch will allow a user to specify content
    type by using upload command or modify the content type by using
    post command.
    
    For example:
    1. To upload an object with specific content type:
    swift upload -H content-type:applicaiton/xml con1 file1
    
    2. To modify an object to a specific content type:
    swift post -H content-type:application/josn con1 file1
    
    This patch also allow a client to specify other request headers.

    Use testr instead of nose.
    
    nose is invasive and can sometimes alter the outcome of a test run. testr,
    on the other hand, keeps a distinction between running tests and displaying
    results of the test runs. Additionally, it supports the stock python unittest
    protocol.
    
    Even better, testr supports parallel test running, which makes things faster,
    and a command "testr run --failing" which will just re-run the latest failing
    tests (often something one wants to do in iterative dev)

    Don't add trailing slash to auth URL.
    
    Adding a trailing slash to the authentication URL may interfere with
    auth service implementations not using /FOO/ but /FOO as authentication
    URL.
    
    OpenStack Object Storage API 1.0 doesn't specify that the auth URL must
    end in a slash and swiftclient.client doesn't force it either.

    Force utf-8 encode of HTTPConnection params
    
    This patch forces swiftclient to encode to utf-8
    all url and headers arguments, to avoid the
    UnicodeDecodeError which is raised by '\r\n'.join([])
    invoked in htplib.py.
    
    Currently the affected projects are Horizon(upload file
    with unicode name) and swiftclient CLI('swift post' with
    unicode filename as header)
    
    This is also a follow-up of this review:
        https://review.openstack.org/#/c/14216/
    
    I'd still want to hear what the Swift core devs
    think of it. Is it better to create a new
    AutoEncodingHTTPConnection? Or to handle the connection
    creation and make sure there are no unicode and utf-8
    string at the same time. If these unicode checks have to
    be added in the calling code(Dashboard, CLI), there are
    so many places to be added, and also in all new commands
    that might be exposed from the API.

    Add ability to download without writing to disk.
    
    This patch adds a "--no-download" option to the "download" command.
    When given, all writing to disk is bypassed, while still actually
    downloading the data and validating etags.
    
    This can be handy when you're using the swift command-line client to
    test out a swift cluster and don't want client-side disk writing to be a
    bottle-neck (but you still want to know about any etag validation
    failures).

    will return the version of swiftclient being used.

    Use keystoneclient for authentication.
    
    - This allows us to delegate all 2.0 authentication directly to the
      library without reimplementing ourselves.
    - Support reusing a token / storage-url without re-authenticating every
      time via the switch os_storage_url os_auth_token.
    - Allow auth via tenant_id instead of just tenant_name via the switch
      os_tenant_id.
    - Refactor a bit to make it easier in the future to add new OS features
      (i.e: region).
    - Implements blueprint use-keystoneclient-for-swiftclient.
    - Fixes bug 1016641.

    Configurable concurrency for swift client.
    
    The 'delete', 'download', and 'upload' commands use multiple threads
    for concurrency. However, the number of threads was hardcoded at
    10. This patch simply makes those configurable.
    
    For example, if I'm downloading a lot of files but I don't want to
    saturate the downstream on my Internet connection, I might choose to
    use only 1 or 2 threads for object downloads. Conversely, if I'm
    uploading a lot of small files across a fast network, I would want
    lots of threads to speed things along.
    
    The default number of threads is 10, so the default behavior is
    unchanged.

    Allow specify tenant:user in user.
    
    We allow having the syntax tenant:user in user since this would make
    things easier when switching from auth 1.0 to auth 2.0 and not having to
    specify a tenant_name.
    
    In the feature we should use the auth functions from keystoneclient and
    be done with those changes, we could then auth by user/tenant-ID.

    Make swift exit on ctrl-c.
    
    The first time the user presses ctrl-c, all QueueFunctionThreads will
    have abort=True set on them. This will cause them to finish the work
    they're doing (e.g. finish uploading the current file) but then ignore
    any further work and let the process exit. Also, a notification of
    this is written to stderr so the user understands why the process
    didn't exit immediately.
    
    The second time the user presses ctrl-c, the process will exit
    immediately. Any in-progress operations are abandoned.

    Make swift not hang on error.
    
    Before, if a QueueFunctionThread's function raised an exception, then
    its thread would log the exception and exit, leaving the rest of the
    jobs in the queue and ensuring that the swift client would hang.
    
    Now, the exception is logged and processing continues, so all the
    messages get handled eventually and the client exits.
