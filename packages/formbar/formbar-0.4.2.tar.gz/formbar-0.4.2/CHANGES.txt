TODO
====

- Added Testcases for i18n.
- Added Testcases Custom renderers.

0.4.2
=====

- Added support for File Fields.

0.4.1
=====

- Added support for table rendering as additional layout element. Follows
  basically the html syntax (table, tr, th, td).
- Added support InfoFields. Infofields are not part of the datamodel. The are
  used to display dynamic calculated values.
- Added helper script "generate.py" to generate various information about the
  form configuration. E.g generate the SQLAlchemy model.
- Added optional request param for form initialisation. The current request
  from a wenframeform can no be provided to the form. This might be usefull
  while rendering with external renderers.

0.4.0
=====

- Removed FormAlchemy dependency. This includes some internal refactoring as
  the rendering and converting of values (especially relations) must now be
  done by formbar.

0.3.1
=====

- Fixed readonly view for textarea. Replace \n with <br>
- Added "in" rule operand. ($field in ['1','2','3'])

0.3
===

- Added a configurable JS-Callback function which is called when the user
  changes the currently selected page. The function will sent some information
  (selected page, item, itemid) to a configurable URL. The server behind the
  URL can save these values in a session and reuse it to preselect the page on
  the next form rendering.

Form-Rendering:
- Splitted up rendering of forms. The Fieldrenderer now renders label, field,
  help and errors seperately for each field.
- Enabled customs Renderers. Among the default FA Renderes wen can now
  configure our own renderers more easly. The goal is to  get rid of the FA
  Alchemy dependencie.

0.2.2
=====

- Added a new DatefieldRenderer which uses a bootstrap specific datepicker
  widget. Needs JS. Currently this widget is used if the datetype "date" is
  provided.
- Added helper method to get the needed JS code for formbar. Needed in other
  libraries.
- Renderer is not set depending on the datatype anymore. Default renderer is
  a TextfieldRenderer or the Renderer set by Formencode.
- Renderer is only set by the renderer attribute for an entity
- Fix in setup.py. Use hgtools to build package.
- Added support for pages in forms.


0.2.1
=====

- Added support for i18n. A translation function like gettext can now be
  injected on initialisation of a form.

0.2
===

- Implemented dropdonw field
- Layout Change. Field height is now 30px to match the Ringo form layout.
