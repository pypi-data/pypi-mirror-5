A plugin for TiddlyWeb subclassing tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy3 with mysql specifics.

The main additions to sqlalchemy3 are:

* Optionally provide a reasonable search interface using mysql's fulltext.
* Provide field based searches of tiddler attributes and fields.
* Support finding tiddlers that have geo.lat and geo.long fields
  near a location.
* Provide an index_query method to allow the plugin to be used as
  an 'indexer' for filters and determine_bag_for_tiddler.

NOTES

MySQL 5.5 or beyond is required for full Unicode support.

It is important to set some mysql my.cnf variables if you are using
the fulltext indexing otherwise searches will likely fail.

[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len = 3
ft_stopword_file = ''

You will need to create a database. I use one called 'tiddlyweb':

    create database tiddlyweb \
        character set = utf8mb4 \
        collate = utf8mb4_bin;

Make sure you GRANT appropriate PRIVILEGES on the database.

Add the following to tiddlywebconfig.py:

    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.mysql', {
        'db_config': 'mysql:///tiddlyweb?charset=utf8mb4'}],
    'indexer': 'tiddlywebplugins.mysql',

If you want to use the fulltext indexing capability you will need to
create the fulltext index:

    CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX tiddlytext ON text(text);

Also set 'mysql.fulltext' to True in tiddlywebconfig.py. This makes
sure the text table is MyISAM.

Note that even if fulltext is not turned on, text searches will still
work, but not as flexibly.

some SQL humps.
