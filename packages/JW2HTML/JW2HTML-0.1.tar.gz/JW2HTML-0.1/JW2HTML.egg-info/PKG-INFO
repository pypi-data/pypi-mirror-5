Description: Alas, there is no epub version of the Jungle World, http://jungle-world.com . Hence this little module to download the current issue and pack it into one HTML file which can then be converted to epub (using e.g.  http://calibre-ebook.com). It also downloads the cover image for easy inclusion when creating the book in calibre.
