# SSP - Speech Signal Processing module

SSP is released under the Gnu GPL version 3.  See the file `COPYING`
for details.

To install SSP, something like this ought to work:
```sh
mkdir lib
cd lib
git clone git@github.com:idiap/ssp.git
export PYTHONPATH=~/lib
```

Then in some working directory
```sh
ln -s ~/lib/ssp/bin/pitch.py
ln -s ~/lib/ssp/bin/codec.py
```

Then you can say
```sh
pitch.py test.wav  # Graphical view of what's going on
codec.py -h
codec.py -r 22050 -p EM1.wav EM1.lf0
```

Otherwise, see the wiki at https://github.com/idiap/ssp/wiki
