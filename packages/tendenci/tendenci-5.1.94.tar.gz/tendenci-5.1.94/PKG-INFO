Description: # Tendenci
        
        Tendenci 5.+ is the next iteration of a product started in 2001 and released open source in 2012. It is built specifically for NPOs (Non Profit Organizations.) We started with a focus completely on associations but now being open source GPL it is much broader in scope. 
        It is a content management system (CMS) with powerful features for event registration, membership management, donations, payments, email integration and much more.
        
        Tendenci allows membership management organizations to communicate, manage and conduct transactions with web site visitors. Tendenci is easy to use and offers many modules as one customizable software package. The 5.x version is open source and built on Django/Python/Postgres and Ubuntu.
