Changelog for Acrylamid
=======================

0.7.6 (2013-06-06)
------------------

### What's new?

- filter configuration is now part of its internal hash and will mark the
  cache object as invalid to force recompilation. Appendum to #118.
- #124 – summarize and intro filter ignore img, audio & video tags by default.
  You can disable this feature by setting `*_IGNORE` to an empty list (`[]`).
- Windows compatibility (thanks to Matt Wilkie)

### What changes?

- Assuming UTF-8 as default encoding for I/O. This circumvents several issues
  on Windows and Ubuntu with an ASCII `locale.getpreferredencoding` although
  the locale encoding has been set to something different than ASCII.

  If your system uses a different encoding than UTF-8, Acrylamid may fail to
  read already existing files in the output directory. Removing `output/`
  solves the error.

### What has been fixed?

- TypeError in `acrylamid view` under Python 3
- regression in 'absolute' filter introduced with new joinurl functionality
- `OverflowError` for date time objects before 1970 (UNIX time epoch) has
  been resolved. Acrylamid now supports date time objects beginning from
  01.01.1900. Datetimes before 1990 are not supported by python's datetime API
  and the exact beginning may vary. I live in UTC+1 and can't use the 1.1.1990
  because it is actually 1899. Please keep this in mind.

0.6 (2013-02-12)
----------------

Released on February, 12th, 2013 – Almost stable.

### What's new?

- #105 – new archive view to render yearly, monthly and/or daily archives and
  has replaced the article view in the themes. The article view remains in
  the Acrylamid core but is likely to become deprecated in the future.
- #104 – simple and advanced, multhithreaded hooks during compilation, see
  http://posativ.org/acrylamid/hooks.rst for more information.
- Jinja2 content filter imports macros from theme/macros.html
  automatically into your entry namespace.
- #102 – enrich HTML metadata
- #101 – pandoc metadata recognition (initial implementation by Daniel Pritchard)
- #91  – CoffeeScript and IcedCoffeScript conversion for assets
- summarize filter accepts `<!-- more -->` as additional break keyword.

### What changes?

- the index pagination route has been changed to `/page/:num/`, notice the
  trailing slash. If you use the default index pagination route, this will
  immediately break as Acrylamid tries to create a file named `:num`. This
  also applies to the tag pagination.

### What has been fixed?

- the Jinja2 Atom and RSS templates do not longer indent the content as this
  causes unexpected indentation inside `<pre>` tags. This does not affect the
  Mako templates.
- #117 – fix a redirection issue where `/foo` has been resolved to
  `/output/foo/` instead of `/foo/` solely.
- #116 – serving from non-root path has been fixed
- #111 – prevent duplicate summarize link insertion for modus 0
- sitemap may have included drafts unintentional if routed through `'/drafts/'`
- automatically adding the index.html to any route without checking if the
  path has already an extension. Now, Acrylamid only appends an `index.html`
  to a final URL if the location ends with a trailing slash.
- auto-compilation now detects changes in the static directories (if any)
- improved Mako support and tests
- double angle quotes hardcoded into the entry view have been moved into the
  theme, you should adapt your theme as well.
- changed Markdown HTML output from XHTML1 to XHTML5
- better link recognition for the PingBack feature
- ignore files included by the `@import` statement in SASS/SCSS/LESS
- #103 – pass encoded values into `os.environ` to allow fancy unicode
  characters such as » or Aкриламид.

0.5 (2013-01-20)
----------------

Released on January, 20th 2013 – Winter Is Coming!

### What is new?

- speed improvements (up to 25%) due new internal hash (Adler32 vs. MD5)
  and detection of changes in your configuration, environment and posts.
- #7 –  static site search backend (not yet integrated into any theme, still
  waiting for a new default theme based on `syte`. The static site search is
  documented in docs/ and Acrylamid ships a python script to query the index.
- multiple views per rule! So, in theory you can map pages, posts, drafts
  and translations to `/:slug/`.
- #95 – add "read more" support for intro filter (Alexander Zhirov)
- #90 – specify alternate configuration file via `--conf /path/to/conf.py`
- #87 – new reStructuredText directive for Vimeo (the\_metalgamer)
- #82 – updated Atom feed to include tags, icon and provides a unique id for
  multiple destinations (Mark van Lent)
- improved WordPress import (pages and draft recognition)
- integrated web server blocks browser requests during (auto) compilation
- #78 – `acrylamid import` now uses RSS/Atom categories as tags
- #80 – new config variable `CONTENT_EXTENSION` to set the default filename
  extension when using `acrylamid new`, defaults to `.txt` (Günter Kolousek)
- new asset writer: `Jinja2` for the `.html` extension
- new filter: `intro` shows up to N paragraphs (`<p>...</p>`).

### What changes?

- `env.views` is now a list containing the actual view objects, but retains
  `if 'sitemap' in env.views` and `env.views['sitemap']` syntax.
- entry view no longer generates drafts. This might break your `conf.py`. To
  enable drafts, replace `"view": "entry"` with `"views": ["entry", "draft"]`
  inside your `"/:year/:slug/"` view.
- relative URIs in feeds are now absolute per default. URI fragments such as
  `#fn:1` are now distinct (relative to `WWW_ROOT`) in the index and tag view.
  To change this behavior, add `norelative` and `noabsolute` to the affected views.
- SASS/SCSS and LESS conversion are no longer in Acrylamid's defaults (if
  available), hence you have to include them via `STATIC_FILTERS += ['SASS', ...]`

### What was fixed?

- compatibility with python 3.2 is now assured by the testsuite
- auto compilation gets slower for each iteration
- #95 – fix assets not being copied when multiple directories (Christoph Polcin)
- #94 – more accurate intro generation (Alexander Zhirov)
- #73 – LESS and SASS conversion is now optional
- #67 – track referenced entries for updates
- #86 – escape YAML blocks ("[" and "]") properly
- #85 – empty posts in WordPress dump broke the import
- #84 – TypeError in the second run during auto compilation
- #82 – theme files copied to output if they are not used
- #77 – missing items in sitemap view
- #75 – dotfiles not copied from the static folder (Mark van Lent)
