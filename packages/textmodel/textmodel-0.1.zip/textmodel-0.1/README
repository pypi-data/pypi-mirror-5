Textmodel is a datatype which can hold textstrings together with
format information. It is similar to GtkTextBuffer in functionality,
but it is completely independent of a gui-toolkit.

Wxtextview is an example widget written for the wx toolkit. It has the
basic functionality of a text editor. It is developed and tested on
windows only and I have no idea if it works correctly on other
platforms.

Textmodel and wxtextview are experimental. They are neither bug free
nor stable.  Wxtextview lacks the configurability which you might
expect from a real text widget. Hack it to fit you needs.


1. USAGE
~~~~~~~~

using textmodel:

    from textmodel import TextModel, defaultstyle
    
    text = TextModel(u'Hello World!')

    # highlight the word "World"
    text.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor = 'yellow')

    # query the color
    print text.get_style(0)['bgcolor'] # --> color of first character
    print text.get_style(10)['bgcolor'] # --> color of last character


    # defaultstyle is just a dict
    print defaultstyle
    # -> {'bgcolor': 'white', 'textcolor': 'black', 'fontsize': 10, 'selected': False}

    # you can change it
    defaultstyle.clear()
    defaultstyle['underline'] = False
    defaultstyle['italic'] = False

    # test:
    text = TextModel(u'Hello World!')
    text.set_properties(6, 11, underline = True)
    print text.get_style(10)
    # -> {'underline': True, 'italic': False}



using the wxtextview-widet:

    from textmodel import TextModel
    from wxtextview import WXTextView

    import wx
    app = wx.App()


    model = TextModel(u'Hello World!')
    model.set_properties(6, 11, fontsize=14)
    model.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor='yellow')

    # display the texmodel in a view 
    frame = wx.Frame(None)
    view = WXTextView(frame, -1)
    view.model = model
    frame.Show()

    # set cursor and selection
    view.cursor = 5
    view.selection = 0, 5

    # display the same textmodel in a second view
    frame2 = wx.Frame(None)
    view2 = WXTextView(frame2, -1)
    view2.model = model
    frame2.Show()

    app.MainLoop()

Most python files contain tests and demos. For example:

$ cd textmodel/
$ python  textmodel.py
