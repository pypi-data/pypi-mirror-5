Description: 
            chemlab is a python library and a set of utilities built to ease the
            life of the computational chemist. It takes inspiration from other
            python scientific library such as numpy scipy and matplotlib, and aims
            to bring a consistent and simple API by following the python
            guidelines.
        
            Computational and theoretical chemistry is a huge
            field, and providing a program that encompasses all aspects of it is an
            impossible task. The spirit of chemlab is to provide a common ground
            from where you can build specific programs. For this reason it
            includes an easily extendable molecular viewer and flexible data
            structures field-independent.
