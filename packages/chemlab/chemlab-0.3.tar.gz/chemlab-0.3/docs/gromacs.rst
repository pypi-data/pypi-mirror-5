Using GROMACS with chemlab
==========================

GROMACS is one of the most used packages for molecular simulations,
chemlab can provide a modern and intuitive interface to generate input
and analyze the output of GROMACS calculations.  To illustrate the
concepts we'll perform a very simple simulation of liquid water.
   
Installing GROMACS
------------------

This depends on the system you're using but I believe that GROMACS is
already packaged for most linux distributions and also for other
operating systems.

In Ubuntu::

    $ sudo apt-get install gromacs

What GROMACS needs
------------------

In order to run a minimum simulation GROMACS requires to know some
basic properties of the system we intend to simulate. This boils down
to basically 3 ingredients:

1) The starting composition and configuration of our system. 
   This is provided by a ".gro" file that contains the 
   atom and molecule types, and their position in space.
   
2) Information about the connectivity and interactions between our
   particles. This is called topology file and it is provided by
   writing a ".top" file.

3) Simulation method. This will require us to give parameters on how
   we want to make the system evolve. This is provided by an ".mdp"
   file.

chemlab can help us to build any system that we want and we'll use it
to write a ".gro" file. Then we will use chemlab to visualize and 
analyze the result of the GROMACS simulation.

Crafting a box of water
-----------------------

There are many ways to generate a box of water, in our example we
will place 512 water molecules in a cubic grid. The advantages of 
doing that is the simplicity of the approach and the fact that we
are naturally avoid any overlap between adiacent molecules.

To generate such a box we will:

1) Create a template water :py:class:`~chemlab.core.Molecule`;
2) Translate this molecule on the grid points
3) Add the molecule to a preinitialized :py:class:`~chemlab.core.System`.

::
   
    import numpy as np
    from chemlab.core import Atom, Molecule, System
    from chemlab.graphics import display_system
     
    # Spacing between two grid points
    spacing = 0.3
     
    # an 8x8x8 grid, for a total of 512 points
    grid_size = (8, 8, 8)
     
    # Preallocate the system
    # 512 molecules, and 512*3 atoms
    s = System.empty(512, 512*3)
     
    # Water template, it contains export informations for gromacs
    # more about export later...
    water_tmp = Molecule([Atom('O', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], export={'grotype': 'OW'}),
                          Atom('H', [0.1, 0.0, 0.0], export={'grotype': 'HW1'}),
                          Atom('H', [-0.03333, 0.09428, 0.0], export={'grotype':'HW2'})],
                         export={'groname': 'SOL'})
     
    for a in range(grid_size[0]):
        for b in range(grid_size[1]):
            for c in range(grid_size[2]):
                grid_point = np.array([a,b,c]) * spacing # array operation
                water_tmp.move_to(grid_point)
                s.add(water_tmp)
     
    # Adjust boxsize for periodic boundary conditions
    s.box_vectors = np.eye(3) * (8 * spacing)
                
    # Visualize to verify that the system was setup correctly
    display_system(s)

If you run this, it will display the following window:

.. image:: /_static/gromacs_tutorial.png

Awesome! Now we can write the ".gro" file. Notice that when we defined
our water molecule we had to pass an `export` dictionary to the
atoms and molecules. The `export` mechanism is the way used by
chemlab to handle all the variety of different file formats.

In this specific case, gromacs defines its own atom and molecule
names in the ".top" file and then matches those to the ".gro" file
to infer the bonds and interactions.

TODO Add picture of the export dictionary

How do we write the .gro file? Since we've already setup our export
information, this is an one-liner::

    from chemlab.io import datafile
    
    datafile("start.gro", "w").write("system", s)

.top and .mdp files
-------------------

I'll give you directly the gromacs input files to do an NPT simulation
of water, just create those files in your working directory:

topol.top

::

    ; We simply import ready-made definitions for the molecule type
    ; SOL and the atom types OW, HW1 and HW2 
    #include "ffoplsaa.itp"
    #include "spce.itp"

    [ system ]
    Simple box of water
    
    [ molecules ]
    SOL 512

run.mdp

::

    integrator = md
    dt = 0.001
    nsteps = 200000
    nstxtcout = 100
     
    rlist = 0.9
    coulombtype = pme
    rcoulomb = 0.9
    rvdw = 0.9
    dispcorr = enerpres
     
    tcoupl = v-rescale
    tc-grps = System
    ref_t = 300
    tau_t = 0.1
     
    pcoupl = berendsen
    compressibility = 4.5e-5
    ref_p = 1.0
     
    gen_vel = yes
    gen_temp = 300
    constraints = all-bonds



Running the simulation
----------------------

To run the simulation with gromacs we have to do two steps:

1) Generate a parameter input, this will check that our input
   make sense before running the simulation::
   
     grompp_d -f run.mdp -c start.gro -p topol.top

   This will generate a bunch of files in your working directory.

2) Now we run the simulation, in the meantime, go grab coffee::

     mdrun_d -v

   This will take a while depending on your machine. If you are not
   a coffee drinker, don't worry, you can stop the simulation by pressing
   Ctrl-C. The good news is that chemlab can read files from partial 
   runs!
   
Viewing the results, the command-line way
-----------------------------------------

To quickly preview trajectories and system energies you can use the
script `chemlab` included in the distribution in `scripts/chemlab`.

GROMACS can store the trajectory (in the form of atomic coordinates) in
the `.xtc` file. To play the trajectory you can use the command::

  $ chemlab view start.gro --traj traj.xtc

.. note:: the ``nstxtcout = 100`` option in the mdp file sets the
          output frequency in the xtc file

You may also be interested to look at some other properties, such as 
the potential energy, pressure, temperature and density. This information
is written by GROMACS in the ".edr" file. You can use the chemlab script 
to view that::

  $ chemlab gromacs energy ener.edr -e Pressure
  $ chemlab gromacs energy ener.edr -e Temperature
  $ chemlab gromacs energy ener.edr -e Potential
  $ chemlab gromacs energy ener.edr -e Density

.. warning:: The chemlab gromacs command is a work in progress, the
             syntax may change in the future.

It is also possible to view and get the results by directly reading
the files and have direct access to the xtc coordinates and the energy
stored in the edr files. Take a look at the reference for
:py:class:`chemlab.io.handlers.XtcIO` and
:py:class:`chemlab.io.handlers.EdrIO`.
