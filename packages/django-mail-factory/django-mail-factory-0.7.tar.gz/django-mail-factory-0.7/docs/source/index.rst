Welcome to django-mail-factory's documentation!
===============================================

Django Mail Factory is a little Django app that let's you manage emails
for your project very easily.

Features
--------

Django Mail Factory has support for:

 * Multilingual
 * Administration to preview or render emails
 * Multi-alternatives emails: text and html
 * Attachments
 * HTML inline display of attached images


Other resources
---------------

Fork it on: http://github.com/novagile/django-mail-factory/

Documentation: http://django-mail-factory.rtfd.org/


Get started
-----------

From PyPI::

    pip install django-mail-factory

From the github tree::

    pip install -e http://github.com/novagile/django-mail-factory/

Then add ``mail_factory`` to your *INSTALLED_APPS*::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'mail_factory',
        ...
    )


Create your first mail
----------------------

:file:`my_app/mails.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    from mail_factory import factory
    from mail_factory.mails import BaseMail

    class WelcomeEmail(BaseMail):
        template_name = 'activation_email'
        params = ['user', 'site_name', 'site_url']

    factory.register(WelcomeEmail)

Then you must also create the templates:

* :file:`templates/mails/activation_email/subject.txt`

::

    [{{site_name }}] Dear {{ user.first_name }}, your account is created


* :file:`templates/mails/activation_email/body.txt`

::

    Dear {{ user.first_name }},

    Your account has been created for the site {{ site_name }}, and is
    available at {{ site_url }}.

    See you there soon!


    The awesome {{ site_name }} team


* :file:`templates/mails/activation_email/body.html` (optional)


Send a mail
-----------

**Using the factory**:

.. code-block:: python

    from mail_factory import factory


    factory.mail('activation_email', [user.email],
                 {'user': user,
                  'site_name': settings.SITE_NAME,
                  'site_url': settings.SITE_URL})


**Using the mail class**:

.. code-block:: python

    from my_app.mails import WelcomeEmail


    msg = WelcomeEmail({'user': user,
                        'site_name': settings.SITE_NAME,
                        'site_url': settings.SITE_URL})
    msg.send([user.email])


How does it work?
-----------------

At startup, all :file:`mails.py` files in your application folders are
automatically discovered and the emails are registered to the factory.

You can then directly call your emails from the factory with their
``template_name``.

It also allows you to list your emails in the administration, preview and test
them by sending them to a custom address with a custom context.
