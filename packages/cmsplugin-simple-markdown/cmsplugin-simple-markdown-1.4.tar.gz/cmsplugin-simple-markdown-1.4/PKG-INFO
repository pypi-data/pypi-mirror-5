        Simple Markdown plugin is just an simple markdown plugin for django-cms.
        It's brutally simple. Just a text area and you'll entered some markdown text and save it.
        And the reason why i make this is that, I really couldn't find any simple as stupid plugin
        for django-cms, all i've found was fancy with a lot of java script stuff.

        Configuration
        ==============
        
        Most people says that installation of cmsplugin-simple-markdown is easy, Seems they're out of space.
        It's fucking hard to install.
        
        Configuration & Usage
        ----------------------
        
        1. Add ``cmsplugin_simple_markdown`` to  ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        2. Add ``django.contrib.markup`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, if it isn't included already.
        3. Create the database tables::
        
            $ python manage.py migrate
        
        
        This is not easy, It's hard, confusing. I doubt, double doubt that those people that keep saying installing this
        is easy are on something.
        
        
        Drama story
        ===========
        Since every application won't begins with love, this plugin developed to solve a problem.
        2 days back, I've been using **cms.plugin.text** for handling html pages and related content,
        but when I've tried to use aws s3/cloudfront for my static files, i've stuck with ``CORS`` problem.
        So i've develop ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown`` to be used without any deps on js/css files.
        
        Now these days, people all around the world are using it, They are happy with it, They go creazy with ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown``,  
        Even they name their child ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown``, At least I did. ;)
