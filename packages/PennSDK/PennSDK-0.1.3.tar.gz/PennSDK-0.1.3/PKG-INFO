Description: Penn Course API Client for Python
        =====
        
        This module is a thin Python wrapper for the Penn registrar API that provides basic convenience
        functions for consuming all three API endpoints.
        
        Full API documentation [here](https://esb.isc-seo.upenn.edu/8091/documentation/).

        Running Tests
        -----
        
        To run the tests, you first must obtain an API username and password (see the [main documentation](https://esb.isc-seo.upenn.edu/8091/documentation/)).
        
        Once you have these, create a `tests/credentials.py` file with them as constants:
        
        ```
        USERNAME = 'MY_USERNAME'
        PASSWORD = 'MY_PASSWORD'
        ```
        
        Then run `python tests/registrar_tests.py`.
