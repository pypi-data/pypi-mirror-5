Django-rwiki - Installation instructions
=============================================

Creating an enviroment for your project
---------------------------------------

You have to create an environment where everything will be installed.
Create first the directory where the environment will be created and
enter in the enviroment:

::
	$ mkdir myproject
	$ cd myproject
	$ virtualenv --distribute env
	$ source env/bin/activate


Creating a new django project
-----------------------------

Once you're into the enviroment, next step involves creating a new
django project. So, being inside the virtual environment, we must
install django (required dependency, of course) and then, create the project:

::

	$ pip install django


Installing Django-rwiki
-----------------------------

Now we have a real project, we're ready to import Django-rwiki, so
we can handle it managing the following pip command:

::

    $ pip install django-rwiki

Configuring project
-------------------

We have to configure a new project. You have to "merge" the urls.py and
settings.py files:

::

	$ cd src/
	$ python manage.py syncdb
	$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


::
	http://localhost:8000/rwiki/
	http://localhost:8000/admin/rwiki/

Templates
---------

If you want to override the templates you only have to copy them from
templates directory to your project and change all what you need.
