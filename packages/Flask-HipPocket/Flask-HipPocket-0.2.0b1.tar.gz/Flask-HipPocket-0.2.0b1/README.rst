    Circular imports have you down? Looking for a better way to build mid-to-large scale systems? Pop that flask into your hip pocket and take a brisk walk to clear your head.


What is it?
-----------

Flask-HipPocket is a collection of convenience wrappers for the already intensely useful Flask_ web framework.

At its core are two classes:

``Mapper``
    Enable centralized URL mapping based on ``LazyLoader`` from `Flask's documentation`_

``HipPocket``
    A wrapper to enable running setup tasks on a Flask application at startup.

``HipPocket`` itself also comes with two pre-defined tasks:

``autoload``
    Load blueprints from a package and auto-register them with Flask
    To add a new blueprint to an autoloading application simply drop in a sub-package and reload your server.

``setup_errors``
    Add basic error responses for all HTTP error codes.

Can I use it?
-------------

It depends on your requirements. Some things to consider:

* It is currently alpha software.
* It is licenced under the MIT licence. 
* It does not yet have full test coverage.
* It has limited `documentation`_.

Contributing
------------

Flask-HipPocket is actively accepting `patches`_ and `feedback`_ at its `GitHub repository`_.
