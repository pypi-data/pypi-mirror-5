        ###
        
        Google App Engine is excellent technology but there is a gap.
        
        If you are missing
        
        -  use of pip with Google App Engine,
        -  cooperation of appengine and virtualenv,
        -  possibility to add any module to your python path,
        
        then this barebone could be at least an inspiration for you.
        
        How to use (fill) the gap?
        ==========================
        
        Short version
        -------------
        workon <myvirtualenv>
        ::
        
            > pip install gap
            > gap start-project <applicationid>
            > cd <applicationid>
            > appcfg update src
        
        Long version
        ------------
        
        1.   Install
             `Google Appengine SDK <https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads>`__
        2.   Create a `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`__ for you project
        3.   if necessary ``easy_install pip``
        4.   run ``pip install gap``
        5.   Go to directory where you want to create your GAE project.
        6.   run ``gap start-project <projectname>``  # <projectname> will be used as applicationId
        7.   Add your dependencies to requirements.gip (format is the same as pip
             `requirements file <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html>`__) and
             run ``bin/gip install -r requirements.gip``
        8.   or install any packages using bin/gip same way as you are used to do it
             with pip.
        9.   To create a new module in your application run ``gap start-app <module_name>``
        10.  Libraries installed using gip are accessible in dev_server as well as on GAE servers.
        
        See `Gap documentation on github <https://github.com/czervenka/gap/blob/master/doc/index.rst>`__ for more
        informations.
