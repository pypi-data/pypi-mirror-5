        ###
        
        Google App Engine is excellent technology but there is a gap.
        
        If you are missing
        
        -  use of pip with Google App Engine,
        -  cooperation of appengine and virtualenv,
        -  possibility to add any module to your python path,
        
        then this barebone could be at least an inspiration for you.
        
        How to use (fill) the gap?
        ==========================
        
        -  Install `Google Appengine
           SDK <https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads>`__
        -  Create a virtualenv for you project (not necessary but recommended)
        -  pip install gap
        -  Go to directory of your new GAE project.
        -  gap start-project
        -  Add your dependencies to requirements.gip (format of pip
           `requirements
           file <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html>`__)
        -  Install any packages using bin/gip same way as you are used to do it
           with pip.
        -  To create a new module in your application run gap start-app
        -  Keep your code inside src/app.
        -  You can use any lib you have installed using gip in your project (in
           dev\_server, shell as well as on appengine server).
