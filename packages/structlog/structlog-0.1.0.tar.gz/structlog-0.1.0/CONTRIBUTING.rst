How To Contribute
=================

I’m always grateful for help by generous contributors.
Therefore I’ve collected a few hints to make it easier for you to get started and minimize friction:

- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.rst file in an alphabetical fashion.
  Every contribution shall be credited.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
  This is the only hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation won’t be merged.
- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- Write `good commit messages`_.
- Ideally, squash_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

Thank you for considering to contribute to structlog!
