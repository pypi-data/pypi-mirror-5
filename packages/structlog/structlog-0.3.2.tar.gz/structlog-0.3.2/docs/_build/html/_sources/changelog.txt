=========

- :release:`0.3.2 <2013-09-27>`
- :bug:`0` Fix stdlib's name guessing.
- :release:`0.3.1 <2013-09-26>`
- :support:`0 backported` Add forgotten :class:`structog.processors.TimeStamper` to API documentation.
- :release:`0.3.0 <2013-09-23>`
- :support:`0` Greatly enhanced and polished the documentation and added a new theme based on Write The Docs, requests, and Flask.
  See :doc:`license`.
- :feature:`0` Add Python Standard Library-specific BoundLogger that has an explicit API instead of intercepting unknown method calls.
  See :class:`structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger`.
- :feature:`0` :class:`structlog.ReturnLogger` now allows arbitrary positional and keyword arguments.
- :feature:`0` Add Twisted-specific BoundLogger that has an explicit API instead of intercepting unknown method calls.
  See :class:`structlog.twisted.BoundLogger`.
- :feature:`0` Allow logger proxies that are returned by :func:`structlog.get_logger` and :func:`structlog.wrap_logger` to cache the BoundLogger they assemble according to configuration on first use.
  See :doc:`performance` and the `cache_logger_on_first_use` of :func:`structlog.configure` and :func:`structlog.wrap_logger`.
- :feature:`0` Extract a common base class for loggers that does nothing except keeping the context state.
  This makes writing custom loggers much easier and more straight-forward.
  See :class:`structlog.BoundLoggerBase`.
- :release:`0.2.0 <2013-09-17>`
- :feature:`0` Promote to stable, thus henceforth a strict backward compatibility policy is put into effect.
  See :ref:`contributing`.
- :feature:`0` Add `key_order` option to :class:`structlog.processors.KeyValueRenderer` for more predictable log entries with any `dict` class.
- :feature:`0` :class:`structlog.PrintLogger` now uses proper I/O routines and is thus viable not only for examples but also for production.
- :feature:`0` :doc:`Enhance Twisted support <twisted>` by offering JSONification of non-structlog log entries.
- :feature:`0` Allow for custom serialization in :class:`structlog.twisted.JSONRenderer` without abusing ``__repr__``.
