        black\_magic.decorator
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This is intended to become a more modern and flexible replacement for
        the the well known
        `decorator <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator/3.4.0>`__ module.
        This module benefits an API for more flexible usage. The behaviour of
        the `decorator <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator/3.4.0>`__ module
        can easily be duplicated.
