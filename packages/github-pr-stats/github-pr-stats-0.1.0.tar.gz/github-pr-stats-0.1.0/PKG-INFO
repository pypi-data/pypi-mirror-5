        Hacking
        =======
        
        I highly recommend using virtualenv:
        
        ::
        
            [$]> virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute env
            [$]> source env/bin/activate
            [$]> pip install -r requirements.txt
            [$]> pip install -e . # So we can import the version from inside bin/ .
