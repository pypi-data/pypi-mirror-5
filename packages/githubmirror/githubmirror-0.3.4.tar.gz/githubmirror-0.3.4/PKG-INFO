        ============
        
        A small script to keep a local bare copy of every repo in a Github
        organization, for faster cloning and deploys
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Download and run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Or install from `PyPi`_::
        
            $ pip install githubmirror
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To initialize a bare repository on your local machine for every repository in
        your Github organization::
        
            $ github-mirror init <organization>
        
        By default, github-mirror will create the repositories in your current working
        directory. Override this using the --workdir option.
        
        When your repositories have been initialized, you can now trigger a git fetch
        for each repo by running::
        
            $ github-mirror sync <organization>
        
        To only sync or initialize a single repo, use the --only-repo=<repo> option.
        
        Security
        --------
        
        To access the Github API to find your organization's private repositories,
        github-mirror asks you for an `API token`_. If you create a personal API token,
        it gives the same access to your account as your username and password, but can
        be revoked separately.
        
        github-mirror will save your token to a .githubmirror file in your working
        directory. Please take care to protect this file from unauthorized access.
        
        .. _API token: https://github.com/settings/applications
        .. _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/githubmirror
