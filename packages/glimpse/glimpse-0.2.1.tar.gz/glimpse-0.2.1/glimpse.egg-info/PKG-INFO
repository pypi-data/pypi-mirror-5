Description: ========================================================
        GLIMPSE - The General Layer-wise IMage ProceSsing Engine
        ========================================================
        
        The GLIMPSE project is a library for implementing hierarchical visual models
        in C++ and Python. The goal of this project is to allow a broad range of
        feed-forward, hierarchical models to be encoded in a high-level declarative
        manner, with low-level details of the implementation hidden from view.
        GLIMPSE combines an efficient implementation with the ability to leverage
        parallel processing facilities and is designed to run on multiple operating
        systems using only common, freely-available components. A prototype of
        GLIMPSE has been used to encode an HMAX-like model, achieving results
        comparable with those found in the literature. This project has been
        supported by NSF Grant 1018967 (PIs: Melanie Mitchell and Garrett Kenyon).
        
        Source code for the project can be found on `github
        <https://github.com/mthomure/glimpse-project>`_ and the `Python Package
        Index (PyPI) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/glimpse>`_.
