Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The package plone.formwidget.datetime provides date and time widgets for plone
        to be used with z3c.form and Archetypes. The calendar widget is based on
        JQueryTools Dateinput, provided by plone.app.jquerytools.
        
        The package is a merge of collective.z3cform.datetimewidget
        and archetypes.datetimewidget (which itself was derived from
        collective.z3cform.datetimewidget).
        
        TODO

        * Include popup_calendar.gif as browser-resource in this package.
        * create DateDeltaWidget and DatetimeDeltaWidget
        * use timepicker
