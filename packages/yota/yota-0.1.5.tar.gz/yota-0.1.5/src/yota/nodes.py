class Node(object):
    """ Nodes are holders of context for rendering and displaying validating
    for a portion of your :class:`Form`. This default base Node is designed to
    provide a template along with specific context information to a templating
    engine such as Jinja2. For validation a Node acts as an information source
    or an error sink. Essentially Nodes can be used to source data for use in a
    :class:`Check`, and they can then be delivered some sort of validation
    error via a the internal :attr:`errors` attribute.

    .. note:: By default all keyword attributes passed to a Node's init
        function are passed onto the rendering context. To override this,
        use the
        :attr:`Node._ignores` attribute.

    :param _attr_name: This is how the Node is identified in the Form. If
        populated automatically if the Node is defined in an a Form class
        definition, however if the Node is added dynamically it will need to be
        defined before adding it to the Form.

        rendering context. Mostly a niceity for keeping the rendering context
        clutter free.
    :type _ignores: list

    :param _requires: A List of attributes that will be required at
        render time. An exception will be thrown if these attributes are not
        present.  Useful for things like lists that require certain data to
        render properly.
    :type _requires: list

    :param template: String name of the template to be parsed upon
        rendering.  This is passed into the `Form._renderer` so it needs to
        be whatever that is designed to accept. Jinja2 is looking for a
        filename like 'node' that occurs in it's search path.
    :type template: string

    :param validator: An optional attribute that specifies a
        :class:`Check` object to be associated with the Node. This is
        automatically extracted at parse time and cannot be manipulated
        after Node insertion.
    :type validator: callable
