Description: Yota
        ================
        
        Yota is a Python form library that aims to make generation of web forms fast yet flexible. It is designed to work with AJAX submission/validation or conventional submission methods. If you’re trying to hack something together quickly, Yotas defaults should be well equiped, however it is still configurable enough to let you do more complex actions, even ones it wasn’t originally designed to handle. Yota attempts to allow several ways to do things when it makes sense, but tries to avoid syntax that is overly confusing or non-obvious. Readability takes a backseat to reasonable verbosity.
        
        Yota is designed to be framework agnostic, and should function with framworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid and others. Examples using all of these libraries are to come.
