Description: 
        What Does Simple Enum Do?
        --------------------------
        
        Simple Enum provides a simpler way to define Enums in Python 3::
        
            class Colour(Enum):
                red
                green
                blue
        
        You can see the full documentation (and implementation) on
        `github <https://github.com/andrewcooke/simple-enum>`_.
        
        Why Should I Use Simple Enum?
        ------------------------------
        
        * It makes the common case as simple as possible.
        
        * It detects accidental duplicate values.
        
        * It allows you to easily select alternative values (numbers from one, bit
          fields, etc).
        
        What Else Should I Know?
