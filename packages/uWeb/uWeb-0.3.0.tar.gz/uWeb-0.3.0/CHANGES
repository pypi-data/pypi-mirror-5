v0.3.0 -- 2013-07-14
 - Resolves issue #873 (http://bugs.underdark.nl/issues/873); Common route prefixes are now possible.

v0.2.9 -- 2013-05-09
  - Resolved issue #1472 (http://bugs.underdark.nl/issues/1472); a bad interaction between _PreSave and _PostSave hooks.

v0.2.8 -- 2013-03-20
  - Moved together the login files for the pagemaker package
  - Fixed bug where directory detection for the presenter failed on StandAlone. This resolves problems where template directories fail to work and where error pages fail to display the source of files mentioned in the stacktrace.

v0.2.7 -- 2013-03-14
  - Improved MySQL logging of queries/transactions that raise exceptions: Failed queries no longer log their own exception, this is left to the transaction logger. Transactions themselves no longer log warnings upon failure, instead they log the exception with full query history that the cursor used to log.
  - Fixed a bug on python2.6 where the Unicode decoding error handling needs to be a positional argument, not named.

v0.2.6 -- 2013-03-04
  - Query decoding introduced in 0.2.5 will now ignore errors. This prevents UnicodeDecodeErrors from being raised when the query inserted raw bytes (or otherwise out-of-charset characters) into the database.

v0.2.5 -- 2013-03-01
  - Fixed a bug in standalone which lacked the `datetime` module for log messages.
  - Fixed a bug in the MySQL backend that prevented logging warnings of queries with non-ascii bytes in them. Queries are now decoded to unicode objects which are safe for logging

v0.2.4 -- 2013-02-28
  - Logging no longer performs reverse-DNS lookups. This avoids (long) delays in serving requests.
  - Cleaned up a number of backend MySQL calls

v0.2.3 -- 2013-02-11
  - Newly created projects are no longer pre-attributed to an author
  - Routers for newly created projects no longer get their base directory set incorrectly
  - Demo projects are now have a proper HTML5 doctype

v0.2.2 -- 2013-02-04
  - Fixed a bug where templates and other content placed relative from the pagemaker could not be loaded if the router had been started with a working directory other than root (the default) for standalone projects.

v0.2.1 -- 2013-02-01
  - Fixed a bug with the `uweb` application where the init command would fail due to path problems. Initializing a project now works by calling `uweb init project` and can then immediately be started by calling `uweb start project`.

v0.2 -- 2013-01-31
  - Added a setup script (`uweb`) that allows easy management of standalone development servers.
  - Updated libraries for MySQL database interfacing, significant performance increases
  - Added test-suite for uWeb database model
  - Loading foreign relations for VersionedRecord fields now uses FromIdentifier (as opposed to FromPrimary), so that the most recent version of the record is loaded.

v0.1.alpha2 -- 2012-08-06
  Includes a new version of the database abstraction layer, template parser, and
  includes all data sources for included demo/test projects.

v0.1.alpha1 -- 2012-06-25
  Initial release for Underdark's uWeb package.
