Welcome to µWeb,

The folder you found this readme in contains a bunch of files to form µWeb, its
plugins and various demo and helpfull projects to get you started.

The following webapps are included in the project:
* base_project, this is a bare bones, skeleton Hello world webapp
* logviewer, which allows you to see and browse errors reported by your µWeb
  install and code
* uweb_info, this demonstrated most uweb features, and gives you examples on how
  to use most of them. It also shows you all of your server's environment that
  µWeb knowns about

The program apacheconfig_generator.py allows you to create a working apache
config file for your µWeb project.
