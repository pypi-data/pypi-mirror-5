uWeb
======

uWeb is a small web-framework for Python that just doesn't get in your way. It's complete in the sense that you can run a large web project based on strictly uWeb, but the intergration is loose enough that you can choose not to use certain parts of it, or use your own existing techniqies. We believe this makes it very friendly to developers who already have existing solutions and don't want to conform to the rigidity of other highly-integrated web-frameworks.
