Supported options
=================

``url``

    URL to the package that will be downloaded and extracted. The
    supported package formats are .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, and .zip. The
    value must be a full URL,
    e.g. http://python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/Python-2.4.4.tgz. The
    ``path`` option can not be used at the same time with ``url``.

``path``

    Path to a local directory containing the source code to be built
    and installed. The directory must contain the ``configure``
    script. The ``url`` option can not be used at the same time with
    ``path``.

``prefix``

    Custom installation prefix passed to the ``--prefix`` option of the
    ``configure`` script. Defaults to the location of the part. Note that this
    is a convenience shortcut which assumes that the default ``configure``
    command is used to configure the package. If the ``configure-command``
    option is used to define a custom configure command no automatic
    ``--prefix`` injection takes place. You can also set the ``--prefix``
    parameter explicitly in ``configure-options``.

``share``

    Specify the path in which this package is shared by many other
    packages. When it's unset or blank, it means the package isn't
    shared. Otherwise, it shared by many packages. Recipe will return
    an empty list so that buildout will not uninstall the package when
    uninstalling part.

    In share mode, ``promises`` should be set so that recipe can tell
    whether the package is installed. Otherwise nohting to do.

    If ``share`` is not empty, ``location`` will be set to value of
    ``share``, and remove trailing '/'. So in case ``share`` is '/',
    ``location`` will be set to blank. Thus any reference like
    "${part:location}/bin" in other parts will get the correct value.

    This option is experiment now. Recipe doesn't try to set prefix
    with the valule of this opton in the configure or make command,
    you should specify them accordingly by yourself.

``md5sum``

    MD5 checksum for the package file. If available the MD5
    checksum of the downloaded package will be compared to this value
    and if the values do not match the execution of the recipe will
    fail.

``make-binary``

    Path to the ``make`` program. Defaults to 'make' which
    should work on any system that has the ``make`` program available
    in the system ``PATH``.

``make-options``

    Extra ``KEY=VALUE`` options included in the invocation of the ``make``
    program. Multiple options can be given on separate lines to increase
    readability.

``make-targets``

    Targets for the ``make`` command. Defaults to 'install'
    which will be enough to install most software packages. You only
    need to use this if you want to build alternate targets. Each
    target must be given on a separate line.

``configure-command``

    Name of the configure command that will be run to generate the Makefile.
    This defaults to ``./configure`` which is fine for packages that come with
    a configure script. You may wish to change this when compiling packages
    with a different set up. See the ``Compiling a Perl package`` section for
    an example.

``configure-options``

    Extra options to be given to the ``configure`` script. By default
    only the ``--prefix`` option is passed which is set to the part
    directory. Each option must be given on a separate line.

``patch-binary``

    Path to the ``patch`` program. Defaults to 'patch' which should
    work on any system that has the ``patch`` program available in the
    system ``PATH``.

``patch-options``

    Options passed to the ``patch`` program. Defaults to ``-p0``.

``patches``

    List of patch files to the applied to the extracted source. Each
    file should be given on a separate line.

.. _Python hook scripts:

``pre-configure-hook``

    Custom python script that will be executed before running the
    ``configure`` script. The format of the options is::

        /path/to/the/module.py:name_of_callable
        url:name_of_callable
        url#md5sum:name_of_callable

    where the first part is a filesystem path or url to the python
    module and the second part is the name of the callable in the
    module that will be called.  The callable will be passed three
    parameters in the following order:

        1. The ``options`` dictionary from the recipe.

        2. The global ``buildout`` dictionary.

        3. A dictionary containing the current ``os.environ`` augmented with
           the part specific overrides.

    The callable is not expected to return anything.

    .. note:: The ``os.environ`` is not modified so if the hook script is
              interested in the environment variable overrides defined for the
              part it needs to read them from the dictionary that is passed in
              as the third parameter instead of accessing ``os.environ``
              directly.

``pre-make-hook``

    Custom python script that will be executed before running
    ``make``. The format and semantics are the same as with the
    ``pre-configure-hook`` option.

``post-make-hook``

    Custom python script that will be executed after running
    ``make``. The format and semantics are the same as with the
    ``pre-configure-hook`` option.

.. hook shell command:

``pre-configure``

    Shell command that will be executed before running ``configure``
    script. It takes the same effect as ``pre-configure-hook`` option
    except it's shell command.

``pre-build``

    Shell command that will be executed before running ``make``. It
    takes the same effect as ``pre-make-hook`` option except it's
    shell command.

``pre-install``

    Shell command that will be executed before running ``make``
    install.

``post-install``

    Shell command that will be executed after running ``make``. It
    takes the same effect as ``post-make-hook`` option except it's
    shell command.

``keep-compile-dir``

    Switch to optionally keep the temporary directory where the
    package was compiled. This is mostly useful for other recipes that
    use this recipe to compile a software but wish to do some
    additional steps not handled by this recipe. The location of the
    compile directory is stored in ``options['compile-directory']``.
    Accepted values are ``true`` or ``false``, defaults to ``false``.

``promises``

   List the pathes and files should be existed after install part. The
   file or path must be absolute path. One line one item

   If any item doesn't exist, the recipe shows a warning message. The
   default value is empty.

``dependencies``

   List all the depended parts:

   dependencies = part1 part2 ...

   All the dependent parts will be installed before this part, besides
   the changes in any dependent parts will trigger to reinstall
   current part.

``environment-section``

    Name of a section that provides environment variables that will be used to
    augment the variables read from ``os.environ`` before executing the
    recipe.

    This recipe does not modify ``os.environ`` directly. External commands
    run as part of the recipe (e.g. make, configure, etc.) get an augmented
    environment when they are forked. Python hook scripts are passed the
    augmented as a parameter.

    The values of the environment variables may contain references to other
    existing environment variables (including themselves) in the form of
    Python string interpolation variables using the dictionary notation. These
    references will be expanded using values from ``os.environ``. This can be
    used, for example, to append to the ``PATH`` variable, e.g.::

        [component]
        recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
        environment-section =
            environment

        [environment]
        PATH = %(PATH)s:${buildout:directory}/bin

``environment``

  A sequence of ``KEY=VALUE`` pairs separated by newlines that define
  additional environment variables used to update ``os.environ`` before
  executing the recipe.

  The semantics of this option are the same as ``environment-section``. If
  both ``environment-section`` and ``environment`` are provided the values from
  the former will be overridden by the latter allowing per-part customization.

The recipe uses separated part to support custom options in different
platforms. These platform's part has a pattern "part:platform".

platform could be 'linux', 'cygwin', 'macos', 'sunos', 'freebsd',
'netbsd', 'unixware' ... which equals a formatted sys.platform.

For example,

[bzip2]
recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi

[bzip2:cygwin]
patches = cygwin-bzip2-1.0.6.src.patch

All the options in the [part:platform] have high priority level.

The recipe first searches the exact match, if no found. Ignore arch
and search again, if still found nothing. Use no platform part.

Additionally, the recipe honors the ``download-cache`` option set
in the ``[buildout]`` section and stores the downloaded files under
it. If the value is not set a directory called ``downloads`` will be
created in the root of the buildout and the ``download-cache``
option set accordingly.

The recipe will first check if there is a local copy of the package
before downloading it from the net. Files can be shared among
different buildouts by setting the ``download-cache`` to the same
location.

The recipe honors the ``prefix`` option set in the ``[buildout]``
section either. It implicts all the parts which recipe is
slapos.recipe.cmmi in this buildout process will be installed in the
same ``prefix`` option in the ``[buildout]``. Besides, once it takes
effects, recipe will return all the installed files in the prefix
directory. The own ``prefix`` of part will disable this behaviour.

If the ``buildout`` section has a valid ``prefix`` option, the recipe
will add it to environmet variables as the following:

  PATH=${buildout:prefix}/bin:$PATH
  CPPFLAGS=-I${buildout:prefix} $CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS=-I${buildout:prefix} $CFFLAGS
  CXXFLAGS=-I${buildout:prefix} $CXXFLAGS
  LDFLAGS=-L${buildout:prefix}/lib

Besides, the recipe changes environment variable ``TMP`` when building
and installing, and make a corresponding directory 'tmp' in the
``location``. This temporary directory will be removed after
installing finished.

Example usage
=============

We'll use a simple tarball to demonstrate the recipe.

    >>> import os.path
    >>> src = join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'testdata')
    >>> ls(src)
    - Foo-Bar-0.0.0.tar.gz
    - haproxy-1.4.8-dummy.tar.gz
    - package-0.0.0.tar.gz

The package contains a dummy ``configure`` script that will simply
echo the options it was called with and create a ``Makefile`` that
will do the same.

Let's create a buildout to build and install the package.

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = true
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... """ % src)

This will download, extract and build our demo package with the
default build options.

    >>> print(system(buildout))
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    building package
    installing package

Check option "promises"

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = packagex
    ...
    ... [packagex]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... promises = /usr/bin/myfoo
    ... """ % src)

This will download, extract and build our demo package with the
default build options.

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing packagex.
    packagex: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/packagex/tmp
    packagex: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/packagex__compile__
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/packagex
    building package
    installing package
    packagex: could not find promise "/usr/bin/myfoo"

As we can see the configure script was called with the ``--prefix``
option by default followed by calls to ``make`` and ``make install``.

Installing a Perl package
=========================

The recipe can be used to install packages that use a slightly different build
process. Perl packages often come with a ``Makefile.PL`` script that performs
the same task as a ``configure`` script and generates a ``Makefile``.

We can build and install such a package by overriding the ``configure-command``
option. The following example builds a Foo::Bar perl module and installs it in
a custom location within the buildout::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = foobar
    ... perl_lib = ${buildout:directory}/perl_lib
    ...
    ... [foobar]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... configure-command = perl -I${buildout:perl_lib}/lib/perl5 Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=${buildout:perl_lib}
    ... url = file://%s/Foo-Bar-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... """ % src)

    >>> print(system(buildout))
    Uninstalling packagex.
    Installing foobar.
    foobar: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/foobar/tmp
    foobar: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/foobar__compile__
    building package
    installing package

.. _Installing a package without an autoconf like system:

Installing a package without an ``autoconf`` like system
========================================================

Some packages do not use a configuration mechanism and simply provide a
``Makefile`` for building. It is common in these cases that the build process
is controlled entirely by direct options to ``make``. We can build such a
package by faking a configure command that does nothing and passing the
appropriate options to ``make``. The ``true`` utility found in most shell
environments is a good candidate for this although anything that returns a
zero exit code would do.

We are using a dummy "HAProxy" package as an example of a package with only a
Makefile and using explicit ``make`` options to control the build process.

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = haproxy
    ...
    ... [haproxy]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... configure-command = true
    ... make-options =
    ...     TARGET=linux26
    ...     CPU=i686
    ...     USE_PCRE=1
    ... url = file://%s/haproxy-1.4.8-dummy.tar.gz
    ... """ % src)

    >>> print(system(buildout))
    Uninstalling foobar.
    Installing haproxy.
    haproxy: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/haproxy/tmp
    haproxy: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/haproxy__compile__
    Building HAProxy 1.4.8 (dummy package)
    TARGET: linux26
    CPU: i686
    USE_PCRE: 1
    Installing haproxy

Installing checkouts
====================

Sometimes instead of downloading and building an existing tarball we need to
work with code that is already available on the filesystem, for example an SVN
checkout.

Instead of providing the ``url`` option we will provide a ``path`` option to
the directory containing the source code.

Let's demonstrate this by first unpacking our test package to the filesystem
and building that.

    >>> checkout_dir = tmpdir('checkout')
    >>> import setuptools.archive_util
    >>> setuptools.archive_util.unpack_archive('%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz' % src,
    ...                                        checkout_dir)
    >>> ls(checkout_dir)
    d package-0.0.0

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... path = %s/package-0.0.0
    ... """ % checkout_dir)

    >>> print(system(buildout))
    Uninstalling haproxy.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Using local source directory: /checkout/package-0.0.0
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    building package
    installing package

Since using the ``path`` implies that the source code has been acquired
outside of the control of the recipe also the responsibility of managing it is
outside of the recipe.

Depending on the software you may need to manually run ``make clean`` etc.
between buildout runs if you make changes to the code. Also, the
``keep-compile-dir`` has no effect when ``path`` is used.


Advanced configuration
======================

The above options are enough to build most packages. However, in some cases it
is not enough and we need to control the build process more. Let's try again
with a new buildout and provide more options.

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [build-environment]
    ... CFLAGS = -I/sw/include
    ... LDFLAGS = -I/sw/lib
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%(src)s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... md5sum = 6b94295c042a91ea3203857326bc9209
    ... prefix = /somewhere/else
    ... environment-section = build-environment
    ... environment =
    ...     LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib -L/some/extra/lib
    ... configure-options =
    ...     --with-threads
    ...     --without-foobar
    ... make-targets =
    ...     install
    ...     install-lib
    ... patches =
    ...     patches/configure.patch
    ...     patches/Makefile.dist.patch
    ... """ % dict(src=src))

This configuration uses custom configure options, an environment section,
per-part customization to the environment, custom prefix, multiple make
targets and also patches the source code before the scripts are run.

    >>> print(system(buildout))
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] CFLAGS = -I/sw/include
    package: [ENV] LDFLAGS = -L/sw/lib -L/some/extra/lib
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    package: Applying patches
    patching file configure
    patching file Makefile.dist
    patched-configure --prefix=/somewhere/else --with-threads --without-foobar
    building patched package
    installing patched package
    installing patched package-lib


Customizing the build process
=============================

Sometimes even the above is not enough and you need to be able to control the
process in even more detail. One such use case would be to perform dynamic
substitutions on the source code (possible based on information from the
buildout) which cannot be done with static patches or to simply run arbitrary
commands.

The recipe allows you to write custom python scripts that hook into the build
process. You can define a script to be run:

 - before the configure script is executed (pre-configure-hook)
 - before the make process is executed (pre-make-hook)
 - after the make process is finished (post-make-hook)

Each option needs to contain the following information

  /full/path/to/the/python/module.py:name_of_callable

where the callable object (here name_of_callable) is expected to take three
parameters:

    1. The ``options`` dictionary from the recipe.

    2. The global ``buildout`` dictionary.

    3. A dictionary containing the current ``os.environ`` augmented with
       the part specific overrides.

These parameters should provide the callable all the necessary information to
perform any part specific customization to the build process.

Let's create a simple python script to demonstrate the functionality. You can
naturally have separate modules for each hook or simply use just one or two
hooks. Here we use just a single module.

    >>> hooks = tmpdir('hooks')
    >>> write(hooks, 'customhandlers.py',
    ... """
    ... import logging
    ... log = logging.getLogger('hook')
    ...
    ... def preconfigure(options, buildout, environment):
    ...     log.info('This is pre-configure-hook!')
    ...
    ... def premake(options, buildout, environment):
    ...     log.info('This is pre-make-hook!')
    ...
    ... def postmake(options, buildout, environment):
    ...     log.info('This is post-make-hook!')
    ...
    ... """)

and a new buildout to try it out

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%(src)s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-configure-hook = %(module)s:preconfigure
    ... pre-make-hook = %(module)s:premake
    ... post-make-hook = %(module)s:postmake
    ... """ % dict(src=src, module='%s/customhandlers.py' % hooks))

    >>> print(system(buildout))
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    package: Executing pre-configure-hook
    hook: This is pre-configure-hook!
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    package: Executing pre-make-hook
    hook: This is pre-make-hook!
    building package
    installing package
    package: Executing post-make-hook
    hook: This is post-make-hook!

If you prefer to use shell script, then try these options:
  pre-configure
  pre-build
  pre-install
  post-install

Let's create a buildout to use these options.

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-configure = echo "Configure part: ${:_buildout_section_name_}"
    ... pre-build = echo "OH OH OH" > a.txt
    ... pre-install = cat a.txt
    ... post-install = rm -f a.txt && echo "Finished."
    ... """ % src)

This will run pre-configure, pre-build, pre-install, post-install as
shell command in the corresponding stage.

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    package: Executing pre-configure
    Configure part: package
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    package: Executing pre-build
    building package
    package: Executing pre-install
    OH OH OH
    installing package
    package: Executing post-install
    Finished.

Building in multi-platforms
===========================

The recipe can specify build options for each platform. For example,

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-configure = echo "Configure in common platform"
    ... post-install = echo "Finished."
    ...
    ... [package:cygwin]
    ... pre-configure = echo "Configure in the CYGWIN platform"
    ... pre-install = echo "Installing in the CYGWIN"
    ... post-install = echo -n "CYGWIN " && ${package:post-install}
    ... """ % src)

In the linux, the recipe gets the options from part 'package', there
are only ``pre-configure`` and ``post-install``. the output will be

    #>>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    package: Executing pre-configure
    Configure part: Configure in common platform
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    building package
    installing package
    package: Executing post-install
    Finished.

In the cygwin, the recipe merges the options in the parts 'package'
and 'package:cygwin'. The output will be

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    package: Executing pre-configure
    Configure in the CYGWIN platform
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    building package
    package: Executing pre-install
    Installing in the CYGWIN
    installing package
    package: Executing post-install
    CYGWIN Finished.

Union prefix
============

If the recipe finds ``prefix`` option in the section buildout, it will

  * First, use this ``prefix`` as configure prefix, if
    ``configure-command`` isn't set in the part, or ``make-binary``
    equals 'make' and ``make-target`` includes pattern '\s+install.*'

  * Second, return all the new installed files in the prefix when the
    recipe returns after intall.

  * Finally, change some environment variables(See first section).

Let's see what happens when set prefix in the buildout section:

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ... prefix = ${buildout:directory}/mylocal
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-configure = mkdir -p "${buildout:prefix}"
    ... """ % src)

    >>> print system(buildout)

    building package
    installing package
    package: Getting installed file lists

Look these environment variables and prefix's value, you know what's
the differences.

If part has its own ``prefix``, it will disable above behavious. For
example,

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ... prefix = ${buildout:directory}/mylocal
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... prefix = ${buildout:parts-directory}/package
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-configure = rm -rf "${buildout:prefix}"
    ... post-install = test -d "${buildout:prefix}" || echo "None"
    ... """ % src)

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    package: Executing pre-configure
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    building package
    installing package
    package: Executing post-install
    None

Then no extra environment variables such as CFLAGS etc., and no
${buildout:prefix} directory is created.

The following example shows how to install package, package-2 in one
prefix:

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package package-2
    ... prefix = ${buildout:directory}/mylocal
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-install = sleep 2; mkdir -p "${buildout:prefix}" ; echo x >"${buildout:prefix}/a.txt"
    ... [package-2]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-install = sleep 2; mkdir -p "${buildout:prefix}" ; echo x >"${buildout:prefix}/b.txt"; echo
    ... """ % (src, src))

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.

    package: [ENV] CFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/include
    package: [ENV] CPPFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/include
    package: [ENV] CXXFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/include
    package: [ENV] LDFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/lib
    package: [ENV] PATH = /sample_buildout/mylocal/bin:/usr/bin
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/mylocal
    building package
    package: Executing pre-install
    installing package
    package: Getting installed file lists
    Installing package-2.
    package-2: [ENV] CFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/include
    package-2: [ENV] CPPFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/include
    package-2: [ENV] CXXFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/include
    package-2: [ENV] LDFLAGS = /sample-buildout/mylocal/lib
    package-2: [ENV] PATH = /sample_buildout/mylocal/bin:/usr/bin
    package-2: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package-2/tmp

    package-2: Executing pre-install
    installing package
    package-2: Getting installed file lists

    >>> ls('mylocal')
    - a.txt
    - b.txt

Next we unintall package-2, it should only remove file b.txt:

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ... prefix = ${buildout:directory}/mylocal
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... pre-install = sleep 2; mkdir -p "${buildout:prefix}" ; echo x >"${buildout:prefix}/a.txt"
    ... """ % src)

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package-2.
    Updating package.

    >>> ls('mylocal')
    - a.txt

Magic prefix
============

If configure-command is set, the recipe wouldn't insert "--prefix"
into configure-options. Then it checks whether both of make-binary and
make-targets aren't set, if so, string "prefix=xxx" will be appended
in the make-targets. xxx is the final prefix of this recipe. We call
it Magic Prefix.

In these options magic prefix can be represented by %(prefix)s:

    ``onfigure-command`` ``configure-options``
    ``make-binary`` ``make-options`` ``make-targets``
    ``pre-configure`` ``pre-build`` ``pre-install`` ``post-install``

For example::

  [bzip2]
  post-install = rm %(prefix)s/*.h

The other part can refer to magic prefix of this part by
${part:prefix}, it will return the magic prefix, other than literal
value in the part section. For example,

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package package-2
    ... prefix = /mytemp
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... configure-command = true
    ... make-binary = true
    ...
    ... [package-2]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... configure-command = true
    ... make-binary = true
    ... post-install = echo package magic prefix is ${package:prefix}
    ... """ % (src, src))

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] CFLAGS = -I/mytemp/include
    package: [ENV] CPPFLAGS = -I/mytemp/include
    package: [ENV] CXXFLAGS = -I/mytemp/include
    package: [ENV] LDFLAGS = -L/mytemp/lib
    package: [ENV] PATH = /mytemp/bin:/usr/bin
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    Installing package-2.
    package-2: [ENV] CFLAGS = -I/mytemp/include
    package-2: [ENV] CPPFLAGS = -I/mytemp/include
    package-2: [ENV] CXXFLAGS = -I/mytemp/include
    package-2: [ENV] LDFLAGS = -L/mytemp/lib
    package-2: [ENV] PATH = /mytemp/bin:/usr/bin
    package-2: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package-2/tmp
    package-2: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package-2__compile__
    package-2: Executing post-install
    package magic prefix is /mytemp

Here it's another sample, we change Makefile before installing so it
can display "prefix" value in the stdout.

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... configure-command = ./configure
    ... pre-install = sed -i -e "s/installing package/installing package at \$\$prefix /g" Makefile
    ... """ % src)

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package-2.
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    configure
    building package
    package: Executing pre-install
    installing package at /sample_buildout/parts/package

You even can include pattern %(prefix)s in this option, it will be
replaced with the recipe final prefix.

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... configure-command = ./configure
    ... make-targets = install-lib prefix=%%(prefix)s
    ... pre-install = sed -i -e "s/installing package/installing package at \$\$prefix /g" Makefile
    ... """ % src)

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    configure
    building package
    package: Executing pre-install
    installing package at /sample_buildout/parts/package -lib

Extra part dependencies
=======================

The   recipe  will   treat  all   the   parts  list   in  the   option
``dependencies`` as dependent parts.  zc.buildout will install all the
dependent  parts before  install this  part. For  example,

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... dependencies = package-2
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ...
    ... [package-2]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... """ % (src, src))

Here "package-2" will be installed first, because it's a denpend part
of "package":

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package-2.
    package-2: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package-2/tmp
    package-2: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package-2__compile__
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package-2
    building package
    installing package
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    building package
    installing package

Now let's add a new option for "package-2",

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... dependencies = package-2
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ...
    ... [package-2]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... configure-command = ./configure
    ... """ % (src, src))

Look, "package" is reinstalled either:

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Uninstalling package-2.
    Installing package-2.
    package-2: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package-2/tmp
    package-2: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package-2__compile__
    configure
    building package
    installing package
    Installing package.
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    configure --prefix=/sample_buildout/parts/package
    building package
    installing package

Install share package
=====================

Use option ``share`` to install a share pacakge.
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... share = /usr/local
    ... promises = ${:share}/bin/mypackage.exe
    ... """ % (src,))

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Uninstalling package-2.
    Installing package.
    package: Checking whether package is installed at share path: /usr/local
    package: could not find promise "/usr/local/bin/mypackage.exe"
    package: [ENV] TMP = /sample_buildout/parts/package/tmp
    package: Extracting package to /sample_buildout/parts/package__compile__
    configure --prefix=/usr/local
    building package
    installing package
    package: could not find promise "/usr/local/bin/mypackage.exe"

Do nothing if one package has been installed.
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... newest = false
    ... parts = package
    ...
    ... [package]
    ... recipe = slapos.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/package-0.0.0.tar.gz
    ... share = /usr/local/bin
    ... promises =
    ... """ % (src,))

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Uninstalling package.
    Installing package.
    package: Checking whether package is installed at share path: /usr/local/bin
    package: This shared package has been installed by other package

For even more specific needs you can write your own recipe that uses
``slapos.recipe.cmmi`` and set the ``keep-compile-dir`` option to ``true``.
You can then continue from where this recipe finished by reading the location
of the compile directory from ``options['compile-directory']`` from your own
recipe.
