Description: BaseHash
        ========
        
        BaseHash is a small library for creating reversible obfuscated identifier hashes
        to a given base and length. The project is based on the GO library, [PseudoCrypt][pc]
        by [Kevin Burns][kb]. The library is extendible to use custom alphabets and other
        bases.
        
        The library uses golden primes and the [Baillie-PSW][bp] primality test for hashing 
        to `n` length. From testing, I have gotten `base62` up to `171` in length.
        
        ```
        Maximum number is Base^Length - 1.
        -> 62^171 - 1 or 315485137315301582773830923281251564555089304044116975095028710

        ```
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        ```
        pip install basehash
        ```
        
        Testing
        =======
        
        ```
        nosetests tests/
        ```
        
        Encode
        ------
        ```python
        from basehash import base62
        
        encoded = base62.encode(2013)
        decoded = base62.decode('WT')
        
        print encoded, decoded
        ```
        ```
        WT 2013
        ```
        
        Hash
        ----
        ```python
        from basehash import base62
        
        hashed   = base62.hash(2013, 8)
        unhashed = base62.unhash('6LhOma5b')
        
        print hashed, unhashed
        ```
        ```
        6LhOma5b 2013
        ```
        
        Generating your own primes
        --------------------------
        The default primes are generated using the golden ratio, `1.618033988749894848`
        but this can be changed with `basehash.base.GENERATOR`
        
        ```python
        # Generate primes, default golden ratio.
        GENERATOR = 1.618033988749894848 # Change to whatever you'd like
        ```
        
        Maximum number while hashing
        ----------------------------
        There is a maximum number while hashing with any given base. To find out what
        this number is, we use the `Base^Length - 1` inside the `base_maximum(length)`
        method
        
        ```python
        from basehash import base36
        
        print base36.maximum(12)
        ```
        ```
        4738381338321616895
        ```
        
        So with the max number for `base36` at length `12` as `4738381338321616895` we
        get the following:
        
        ```python
        from basehash import base36
        
        hash = base36.hash(4738381338321616895, 12)
        # 'DR10828P4CZP'
        
        hash = base36.hash(4738381338321616896, 12)
        # ValueError: Number is too large for given length. Maximum is 36^12 - 1.
        ```
        
        Extending
        ---------
        
        ```python
        from basehash.base import *
        
        ALPHA = tuple('24680ACEGIKMOQSUWYbdfhjlnprtvxz')
        
        # Length 'base' is 31 -> len(ALPHA)
        
        def encode(num):
        	return base_encode(num, ALPHA)
        
        def decode(key):
        	return base_decode(key, ALPHA)
        
        def hash(num, length=HASH_LENGTH):
        	return base_hash(num, length, ALPHA)
        
        def unhash(key):
        	return base_unhash(key, ALPHA)
        
        def maximum(length=HASH_LENGTH):
        	return base_maximum(len(ALPHA), length)
        ```

        1.0.7 (2013-07-06)
        ==================
        
        - There was an issue with hashes sometimes being returned one to two charcters
          shorter than `length`, causing `base.base_unhash` to not function properly. To
          fix this, the hashes are right-padded with `0`.
        
        - Since `0` raises an error inside `primes.invmul`, `base.base_unhash` is unable
          to unhash it. To allow the start of your number sequence to be `0` instead of
          `1`, if needed, hashing `base.base_hash(0, length=6)` will return
          `''.rjust(length, alphabet[0])`.
        
        1.0.6 (2013-06-29)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed issues with setup.py. First time using a setup.py within a package,
          first time publishing the library outside of GitHub.
        
        1.0.5 (2013-06-28)
        ==================
        
        - Added nose unittests.
        
        1.0.4 (2013-06-28)
        ==================
        
        - Added setup.py, LICENSE, HISTORY.rst, and .travis.yaml.
        
        1.0.3 (2013-06-27)
        ==================
        
        - Added a simple test for `prime < 31` to reduce calculation time.
        
        - Fixed issue of `strong_pseudoprime(n, 3)` giving false results.
        
        1.0.2 (2013-06-27)
        ==================
        
        - Changed primality test from Miller-Rabin to Baillie-PSW. This algorithm is
          significantly faster.
        
        - Changed determination to use `sqrt(n)` or `isqrt(n)` to an improved version of
          `isqrt(n)`.
        
        - BaseHash is now PEP compliant.
        
        1.0.1 (2013-06-25)
        ==================
        
        - Changed primality test from Fermat to Miller-Rabin. Improved accuracy on false
          results when it comes to pseudoprimes.
