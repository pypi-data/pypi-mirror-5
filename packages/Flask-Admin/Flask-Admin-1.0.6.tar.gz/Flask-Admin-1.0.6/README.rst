Introduction
------------

Flask-Admin is advanced, extensible and simple to use administrative interface building extension for Flask framework.

It comes with batteries included: model scaffolding for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
`MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_, MongoDB and `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_ ORMs, simple
file management interface and a lot of usage samples.

You're not limited by the default functionality - instead of providing simple scaffolding for the ORM
models, Flask-Admin provides tools that can be used to construct administrative interfaces of any complexity,
using a consistent look and feel.

Documentation
-------------

Flask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find `documentation here <http://readthedocs.org/docs/flask-admin>`_.

3rd Party Stuff
---------------

Flask-Admin is built with the help of `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ and `Select2 <https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2>`_.

If you want to localize administrative interface, install `Flask-BabelEx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-BabelEx>` package.

Kudos
-----

Some ideas were taken from the `Flask-Admin <https://github.com/wilsaj/flask-admin-old>`_ by Andy Wilson.

Examples

The library comes with a few examples, you can find them in the `examples <https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin/tree/master/examples` directory.
