        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Flask-Admin is advanced, extensible and simple to use administrative interface building extension for Flask framework.
        
        It comes with batteries included: model scaffolding for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
        `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_, MongoDB and `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_ ORMs, simple
        file management interface and a lot of usage samples.
        
        You're not limited by the default functionality - instead of providing simple scaffolding for the ORM
        models, Flask-Admin provides tools that can be used to construct administrative interfaces of any complexity,
        using a consistent look and feel.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Flask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find `documentation here <http://readthedocs.org/docs/flask-admin>`_.
        
        3rd Party Stuff
        ---------------
        
        Flask-Admin is built with the help of `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ and `Select2 <https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2>`_.
        
        If you want to localize administrative interface, install `Flask-BabelEx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-BabelEx>` package.
