.SH NAME
routelog \- patterns for routing parsed log entries to commands
.SH DESCRIPTION
A
.I routelog
file contains instructions for the
.BR routelog (1)
program of the general form:
.sp
	pattern			command
.sp
Where
.I pattern is a
.BR pcre (3)
regular expression followed by one or more tabs or spaces, followed by
.IR command ,
which is a
.BR sh (1)
.I command
sent via the
.B -c
flag:
.sp
	sh -c command routelog-dispatch
.sp
Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored. Lines whose first
non-space character is a hash-sign
.IR "" "(" "#" ")"
are comments, and are ignored.  Comments are allowed on the same line as cron
commands, but will be handled as comments by
.BR sh (1)
rather than by the
.BR routelog (5)
parser:
.sp
	# this line, and the one below it are discarded entirely

.br
	.*				echo "$*" # this comment is discarded by sh
.sp
.I pattern
may be bounded by slashes
.IR "" "(" "/" ")"
or not. The
.I "/"
syntax is provided to accomidate patterns with spaces:
.sp
	/hi you guys/		echo "pattern is hi you guys; cmd is echo ..."
.br
	/hi \\/ you/		echo "pattern is hi / you; cmd is echo ..."
.br
	hi you guys		echo "pattern is hi; cmd is you guys	echo ..."
.sp
As log entries are read, each entry is searched for
.IR pattern .
If a log\-entry matches, the parser attempts to split log\-entry using the
rules for
.BR sh (1)
argument processing and sends the parsed arguments as positional arguments to
.IR command :
.sp
	2012-12-10:20:45:44 'foo bar' baz "bang"
.br
	+--------+--------+ +---+---+ +++ +-++-+
.br
 	         |              |      |    ||
.br
	        $1             $2     $3    $4
.sp
This allows
.I command
to make use of the parsed log\-entry:
.sp
	# given the above log\-entry
.br
	/.*/				echo "$2"       # foo bar
.br
	/baz/			echo "$*"       # 2012-12-10:20:45:44 foo bar baz bang
.br
	/bang/			echo "${1%%-*}" # 2012
.sp
Should the parser not be able to split the log\-entry using the rules for
.BR sh (1)
it will fall back to split on on or more tabs or spaces:
.sp
	2012-12-10:20:45:44 the corps' very own log line
.br
	+--------+--------+ +++ +----+ +--+ +-+ +-+ +--+
.br
	         |           |    ||    ||   |   |   ||
.br
	        $1          $2    $3    $4  $5  $6   $7
