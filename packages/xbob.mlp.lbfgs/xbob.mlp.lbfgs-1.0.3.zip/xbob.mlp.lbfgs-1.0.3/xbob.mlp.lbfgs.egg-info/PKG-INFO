Description: ============================
         MLP L-BFGS Trainer for Bob
        ============================
        
        This example demonstrates how to extend Bob by providing a new L-BFGS-based
        trainer for the multilayer perceptron (MLP) implementation of Bob.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First, you have to install `bob <http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob>`_ following the instructions
        `there <http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/docs/releases/last/sphinx/html/Installation.html>`_.
        
        .. note:: 
        
          If you are reading this page through our GitHub portal and not through PyPI,
          note **the development tip of the package may not be stable** or become
          unstable in a matter of moments.
        
          Go to `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.mlp.lbfgs
          <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.mlp.lbfgs>`_ to download the latest
          stable version of this package.
        
        There are two options you can follow to get this package installed and 
        operational on your computer: you can use automatic installers like `pip
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_ (or `easy_install
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_) or manually download, unpack and 
        use `zc.buildout <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ to create a
        virtual work environment just for this package. In both cases, the two 
        dependences listed above will be automatically downloaded and installed.
        
        Using an automatic installer
        ----------------------------
        
        Using ``pip`` is the easiest (shell commands are marked with a ``$`` signal)::
        
          $ pip install xbob.mlp.lbfgs
        
        You can also do the same with ``easy_install``::
        
          $ easy_install xbob.mlp.lbfgs
        
        This will download and install this package plus any other required
        dependencies. It will also verify if the version of Bob you have installed
        is compatible.
        
        This scheme works well with virtual environments by `virtualenv
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ or if you have root access to your
        machine. Otherwise, we recommend you use the next option.
        
        Using ``zc.buildout``
        ---------------------
        
        Download the latest version of this package from `PyPI
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.mlp.lbfgs>`_ and unpack it in your
        working area. The installation of the toolkit itself uses `buildout
        <http://www.buildout.org/>`_. You don't need to understand its inner workings
        to use this package. Here is a recipe to get you started::
          
          $ python bootstrap.py 
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        These two commands should download and install all non-installed dependencies and 
        get you a fully operational test and development environment.
        
        .. note::
        
          The python shell used in the first line of the previous command set
          determines the python interpreter that will be used for all scripts developed
          inside this package. Because this package makes use of `Bob`_, you must make sure that the ``bootstrap.py``
          script is called with the **same** interpreter used to build Bob, or
          unexpected problems might occur.
        
          If Bob is installed by the administrator of your system, it is safe to
          consider it uses the default python interpreter. In this case, the above 3
          command lines should work as expected. If you have Bob installed somewhere
          else on a private directory, edit the file ``buildout.cfg`` **before**
          running ``./bin/buildout``. Find the section named ``buildout`` and edit or
          add the line ``prefixes`` to point to the directory where Bob is installed or
          built. For example::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            prefixes=/Users/crazyfox/work/bob/build
        
        
        User Guide
        ==========
        
        It is assumed you have followed the installation instructions for the package
        and got this package installed.
        
        Below, we provide an example of how to train an MLP using this trainer, from 
        the python universe::
        
          >>> machine = bob.machine.MLP((n_inputs, n_hidden, n_outputs))
          >>> # Initialize the machine weights/biases as wished
          >>> trainer = xbob.mlp.lbfgs.Trainer(1e-6)
          >>> trainer.initialize(machine)
          >>> trainer.train(machine, X, labels)
