About
-----

A tool used for the regional analysis of a time series of 2D medical images, typically X-rays or virtual X-rays (output from a computer simulation, such as those created using `pyvXRAY <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvxray>`_).
Intended to be used to evaluate the bone gain / loss in a number of regions of interest (ROIs) over time, typically due to bone remodelling as a result of stress shielding around an orthopaedic implant.
    
Written in pure Python using PyQt4/PySide, pyqtgraph, numpy, PIL and matplotlib. Should work on any platform, but has only been tested on Windows.

How to use
----------

 - Load a time series of 2D medical images (in image format such as bmp, png etc). 
 - Use the up / down arrows below the image file list to place the images in chronological order. A time series of virtual X-rays is provided in the sampleMedicalImages directory. 
 - Create some Regions of Interest (ROIs) and run the ROI analysis tool from the Analyse option on the main toolbar
 - Run the Image analysis tool from the Analyse option on the main toolbar
