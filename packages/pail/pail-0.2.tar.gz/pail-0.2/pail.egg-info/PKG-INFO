Description: pail -- Python Adaptive Images Library
        =======================================
        
        `pail` is a WSGI_ middleware providing `Adaptive Images`_. Delivering
        small images to small devices.

        It detects your visitor's screen size and automatically creates, and
        delivers device appropriate re-scaled versions of your web page's
        embeded HTML images. No (major) mark-up changes needed. It is intended
        for use with `Responsive Designs`_ and to be combined with `Fluid
        Image`_ techniques.
        
        This package is based on the ideas of Matt Wilcox and (more loosely)
        on his `PHP script`_ for the same purpose. Matt is in no way to blame for
        any shortcomings of this Python port.
        
        `pail` provides special support for use with Paste_.
        
        Please note, that this package is still in a very early state and
        changes, also to the API, are likely to happen in near future.
        
        Comments and patches are welcome. Please send these to uli at gnufix
        dot de.

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2 (2013-05-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Add very plain mobile detection. Now, if no device width is given
          (via cookie) detected mobile devices get images with the smallest
          predefined resolution while non-mobile devices get the images with
          the largest predefined resolution.
        
        - Removed zc.buildout stuff (we do not need it).
        
        0.1 (2013-05-07)
        ----------------
        
        - First implementation based on Matt Wilcox' PHP script.
