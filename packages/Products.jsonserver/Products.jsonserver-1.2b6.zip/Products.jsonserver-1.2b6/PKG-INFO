Description: =========================
        JSON/RPC server for Zope2
        =========================
        
        Serve JSON-RPC requests from Zope2. 
        
        Documentation
        *************
        
        The product patches the publisher to serve JSON/RPC requests from within Zope2.
        It is based on:
        
         - original product for earlier versions of Zope2 by Balazs Ree
         - jsonserver for zope3 by Jim Washington jwashin@vt.edu and Contributors
         - ZPublisher/xmlrpc.py
        
        JSON is javascript object notation. JSON-RPC performs the same service
        as XML-RPC, except the format is javascript script objects instead of
        XML, and the content-type is 'application/json-rpc' instead of 'text/xml'.
        
        This project overrides some base zope2 code to provide the additional
        functionality of listening and responding properly to requests of type
        "application/json".
        
        The product was tested with Zope 2.10 and Zope 2.13
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        
        Add this egg to your Zope/Plone buildout.
        
        Usage:
        ------
        
        Similar to xmlrpc usage.
        
        jsonserver looks for content-type "application/json", and handles those
        requests as JSON-RPC.  Other http requests are not affected and will
        presumably work as expected.
        
        For communication other than in a web browser (javascript), simplejson
        or other json implementations have functions for reading and writing
        JSON objects.
        
        The text of a JSON-RPC request looks like::
        
        	{'id':jsonid,''method':remotemethod,'params':methodparams}
        
        where:
        
            o jsonid is a string or number that may identify this specific request
        
            o remotemethod is the method to call on the server
        
            o methodparams is a list(javascript Array) of parameters to the method
        
        The text of a JSON-RPC response looks like::
        
        	{'id':jsonid,''result':returnedresult,'error':returnederr}
        
        where:
        
            o jsonid is the same jsonid as sent in the request
        
            o returnedresult is a javascript representation of the result or null
        
            o returnederr is a javascript representation of an error state
        
        Either returnedresult or returnederr will be the javascript null value.
        
        Actual implementation using e.g., urllib is left as an exercise for the
        reader. Hint:  Use the minjson.write(object) and minjson.read(string)
        methods for conversion before and after transport.
        
        Five extensions
        ---------------
        
        The "json" namespace (http://namespaces.zope.org/json) defines the
        **page** and **pages** directives. **json:page** is identical to
        **browser:page** in the usage, but the page or method declared
        is allowed to be called up in a json request, but will be
        invisible for normal requests.
        
        **browser:page** and **browser:pages** declarations will be
        available to both normal and json requests.
        
        **json:page** declarations will be callable from code and
        their macros will be visible from other templates. ::
        
          <json:page
              name="myjsonrpcview"
              for="*"
              class=".jsonrpc.MyJsonRpcView"
              permission="zope2.ViewManagementScreens"
              />
