Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        You have enabled commenting in your Plone Site.  Now you wake up and
        see that during the night some spammer has added 1337 comments in your
        site.  What do you do now?  Sure, you first shoot him and then you
        integrate some captcha solution, but you still have those 1337
        comments.  You do not want to click 1337 times on a delete button.
        Have no fear: ``zest.commentcleanup`` will rescue you!  Or at least
        it will help you get rid of those spam comments faster.
        
        
        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        Just add ``zest.commentcleanup`` to the eggs parameter of the
        instance section of your buildout.cfg.  On Plone 3.2 or earlier add it
        to the zcml parameter as well.
        
        The package simply works by registering some browser views.  Start
        your instance, go to the root of your site and add
        ``/@@cleanup-comments-overview`` to the url.  This will give you an
        overview of which items in your site have comments.  It is sorted so
        the item with the most comments is at the top.
        
        Note that the overview works on other contexts as well, for example on
        a folder.
        
        In the overview click on the ``manage`` link of an item with comments.
        This takes you to the ``cleanup-comments-details`` page of that item.
        This lists all comments, ordered by creation date.  From there you can
        delete single items.
        
        But the biggest thing you can do there is: select a comment and delete
        this **and all following comments**.  The idea is that the first three
        comments may be valid comments, then there are a gazillion spam
        comments, and very likely no actual human has added a valid comment
        somewhere in that spam flood anymore. So you keep the first few
        comments and delete the rest without having to buy a new mouse because
        you have clicked too much.
        
        From the overview page you can also go to the
        ``@@cleanup-comments-list`` page.  Here you see the latest comments,
        which you can remove one at a time.  This is handier when you have
        done the big cleanup already and only need to check the new comments
        of the last few days.
        
        All the used views are only available if you have the ``Manage
        portal`` permission.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        This has been tested on Plone 3.3.5 with the standard comments.  It
        might or might not work with packages like
        ``quintagroup.plonecomments`` or ``plone.app.discussion``.  It
        probably works on Plone 2.5 and 4 as well, but I have not checked.
        Hey, it might even work in a default CMF site.

        1.6 (2013-05-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Support plone.app.discussion.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.5 (2012-09-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved to github.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.4 (2011-01-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Also catch AttributeError in @@find-catalog-comments, which may
          happen for objects in portal_skins/custom.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.3 (2011-01-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved the remove-buttons more the the left, so they do not hop
          around after deleting an item with a long title, or that causes a
          new long title to appear.
          [maurits]
        
        - On the overview page offer to also index comments in objects that
          currently do not allow comments but may have done so in the past.
          [maurits]
        
        - When switching comments off for an object, uncatalog its existing
          comments.
          [maurits]
        
        - When turning comments on for an object, catalog its possibly
          already existing comments, when needed.
          [maurits]
        
        - On the details page, also show number of actual comments, instead of
          only the comments in the catalog.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added @@find-catalog-comments page (linked from the overview page)
          that finds and catalogs all comments for objects that currently
          allow commenting.  This is needed after a clear and rebuild of the
          portal_catalog, as the catalog then loses all info about comments.

        1.1 (2011-01-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Handle redirection in the same way everywhere, so you also get to
          the same batched page using a came_from parameter.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added '@@cleanup-comments-list' page that lists the latest comments.
