Description: # perfidy
        
        A library adding some important data structures and generic functions to
        Python.
        
        Also contains some code to improve Python's reflection tools.
        
        ## Warning & invitation
        
        This is in very early, experimental stages.  In particular, the API is likely
        to change without notice.  There is no guarantee that this package will be
        maintained.
        
        However, if you are interested in providing Python with decent immutable
        types, then your help would be greatly appreciated.
