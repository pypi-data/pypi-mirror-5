Description: A 'backdoor' shell for running servers (very much like Twisted manhole).
        
        Once installed, you can 'telnet <host> <port>' and run Python commands on your
        server environment. This is very helpful in debugging servers.
        
        This one uses only modules found in the standard library.
        
Platform: any
