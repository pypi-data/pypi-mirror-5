TODO
====


- Bring test coverage back up to 100%
- Figure out a way to avoid recursion so ``loop(print("foo"))`` works as expected.
- Implement TCloneable and TIterable traits
- Try to chnage the semantics of arguments such that:

  - Arguments are evaluated when blocks/methods are called.
  - A copy of unevaluated arguments are available in the message.

- Somehow work out a way to make applying of ``*args`` and/or ``**kwargs`` as well as everything else.

- Do a refresher on how to write an interpreter in RPython and write a really really simple one:
