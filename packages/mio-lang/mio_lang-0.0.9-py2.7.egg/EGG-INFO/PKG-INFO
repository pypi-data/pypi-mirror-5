        mio is a minimalistic IO programming language written in the
        `Python Programming Language`_ based on MIo (*a port from Ruby to Python*)
        in the book `How To Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language`_ by
        `Marc-Andre Cournoye`_.
        
        This project is being developed for educational purposes only and should serve as
        a teaching tool for others wanting to learn how to implement your own programming
        language (*albeit in the style of Smalltalk, Io, etc*). Many thanks go to `Marc-Andre Cournoye`_
        and his wonderful book which was a great refresher and overview of the overall processing
        and techniques involved in programming language design and implementation. Thanks also go to the
        guys in the ``#io`` channel on the FreeNode IRC Network specifically **jer** nad **locks**
        for their many valuable tips and help.
        
        The overall goal for this project is to create a fully useable and working programming language
        implementation of a langauge quite similar to `Io <http://iolanguage.com>`_ with heavy influence
        from `Python <http://python.org>`_ (*because Python is awesome!*). This has already largely been
        achived in the current version. See the `RoadMap <http://mio-lang.readthedocs.org/en/latest/roadmap.html>`_
        for what might be coming up next.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        The simplest and recommended way to install mio is with pip.
        You may install the latest stable release from PyPI with pip::
        
            > pip install mio-lang
        
        If you do not have pip, you may use easy_install::
        
            > easy_install mio-lang
        
        Alternatively, you may download the source package from the
        `PyPI Page`_ or the `Downloads page`_ on the `Project Website`_;
        extract it and install using::
        
            > python setup.py install
        
        You can also install the
        `latest-development version <https://bitbucket.org/prologic/mio-lang/get/tip.tar.gz#egg=mio-lang>`_ by using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
            
            > pip install mio-lang==dev
        
        or::
            
            > easy_install mio-lang==dev
        
        
        For further information see the `mio documentation <http://mio-lag.readthedocs.org/>`_.
        
        
        Changes
        -------
        
        
        mio 0.0.9 2013-11-10
        ....................
        
        - Fixed ``[]`` syntax for creating lists.
        - Fixed ``TIterable foreac`` to work more like a for loop.
        - Introduced properties for internal Python Functions exposed to mio.
        - Adopted calling with ``(...)``'s for all methods.
        - Also format functions in ``format_object(...)``.
        - Added ``__call__`` to ``Error`` objects. This allows:
        
        ::
            
            raise TypeError("foo")
        
        - Added iterator support for ``Range`` object.
        - Renamed ``str`` and ``repr`` methods of ``Object`` to ``__str__`` and ``__str__`` respectively and implemtned ``str`` and ``repr`` builtins.
        - Optimized the tokenizer
        - Added ``ifError``, ``ifNonError`` and ``catch`` to the ``Object`` object to deal with non-errors.
        - Improved and fixed a lot of the builtins.
        - Improved the way ``*args`` is handled (*still needs more work*).
        - Implemented ``assert`` builtin.
        
        
        mio 0.0.8 2013-11-07
        ....................
        
        - Removed operator precedence parsing.
        
          - Operator precedence is **HARD**
          - Operator precedence rules hare **HARD** to remember
          - Operator precedence is not the main goal of mio right now.
        
        - Tidied up the builtins module.
        - ``from foo import *`` works again (*operator precedence parsing broke it*).
        
        
        mio 0.0.7 (2013-11-06)
        ......................
        
        - Added rudamentary stack trace support to errors. A somewhat "okay" stack trace is displayed on error(s).
        - Added ``String format`` method for performing string iterpolation. Only supports ``{0}``, ``{1}``, etc.
        - Implemented ``ListIterator`` iterable object with ``iter`` added to mio std. lib. This works similiarly to Python's iterators:
        
        ::
            
            mio> xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            ===> list(1, 2, 3, 4)
            mio> it = iter(xs)
            ===> ListIterator(list(1, 2, 3, 4))
            mio> it next()
            ===> 1
            mio> it next()
            ===> 2
            mio> it next()
            ===> 3
            mio> it next()
            ===> 4
            
        A further iteration would result in:
        
        ::
            
            mio> it next()
        
              StopIteration: 
              --------------
              next
            ifFalse(
             raise(StopIteration) 
            ) 
        
            raise(StopIteration) 
            
        - Re-implemented ``return`` function as part of the mio std. lib.
        - Don't allow ``return`` to be called outside of a ``Block`` (*block/method*) as this is illegal.
        - Implemented ``while`` builtin as part of the mio std. lib.
          (*no break or continue support yet*)
        - Implemented ``loop`` builtin as part of the mio std. lib.
          (*no break or continue support yet*)
        - Implemented basic support for reshuffling messages before chaining to support ``x is not None`` --> ``not(x is None)``.
        - Finally implemented operator precedence support (*which seems to cover most edge cases*).
        
        .. note:: Need to write lots of unit tests for this!
        
        - Fixed all found edge cases with the new operator precedence lexer/parser.
        - Improved ``Error`` object and added ``Error catch`` method for catching errors.
        - Implemented ``reduce`` builtin.
        - Implemented TComparable trait
        - Implemented TCloneable trait
        - Iterpret ``call message args`` to mean "pass all args to the callable"
        - Imroved Dict and List objects.
        - Implemented ``__call__`` calling semantics whereby an object can implement this as a method and ``Foo()`` will invoke ``Foo __call__`` if it exists.
        - IMplemented the ``__get__`` part of the Data Descriptor protocol.
        
        
        mio 0.0.6 (2013-11-02)
        ......................
        
        - Allow an optional object to be passed to the ``Object id`` method.
        - Implemented ``hex`` builtin.
        - Implemented ``Bytes`` and ``Tuple`` objects.
        - Implemented ``State`` core object and sample ``loop`` builtin (*in testing*).
        - Refactored all of the context state management code (*stopStatus*) and exposed it to the end user.
        
          - This means we can now write flow based constructs such as loops directly in mio.
        
        - Fixed a minor bug in the parser where ``not(0) ifTrue(print("foo"))`` would parse as ``not(0, ifTrue(print("foo")))``
        - Fixed a minor bug in the parser where ``isError`` would parse as ``is(Error)``. Parse identifiers before operators.
        - Implemented basic excpetion handling and error object(s) (*no stack traces yet*).
        - Moved ``exit`` to builtins.
        - Moved the setting of ``.binding`` attribute to ``Object`` ``set/del`` methods.
        - Added support for ``..`` operator and added this to ``Number``. This allows you to write:
        
        ::
            
            x = 1 .. 5  # a Range from 1 to 5
            
        - Added ``+`` and ``-`` operators to the ``Range`` object so you can do things like:
        
        ::
            
            x = (1 .. 5) + 2  # a Range from 1 to 5 in increment of 2
            
        - Changed default REPL prompt to: 
        
        ::
            
            $ mio
            mio 0.0.6.dev
            mio>
            
        - Implemented ``sum`` builtin.
        - Added ``try`` and ``raise`` builtins. (*``raise`` is not implemented yet...*).
        - Added support for User level Error(s) and implemented ``Exception raise``
        - Replaced ``Continuation call`` with activatable object semantics. This means:
        
        ::
            
            c = Continuation current()
            print("foo")
            c()
            
        - ``Object evalArg`` should evaluate the argument with context as the receiver.
        - Added ``List __getitem__`` and ``List __len__`` methods.
        - Added ``TIterable`` trait to the mio bootstrap library and added this to ``List``.
        - Removed ``foreach``, ``whilte``, ``continue``, ``break`` and ``return`` ``Object`` methods. These will be re-implemented as traits and builtins.
        - Changed the way the parser parses and treats operators. They are no longer parsed in a deep right tree.
        
        Example::
            
            1 + 2 * 3
        
        OLD::
            
            1 +(2 *(3))
            
        NEW::
            
            1 +(2) *(3)
            
        - This will probably make reshuffling and therefore implementing operator precedence a lot easier.
        - This also makes the following expressions possible (*used in the builtins module*):
        
        ::
            
            from foo import *
            
        - Added ``TypeError``, ``KeyError`` and ``AttributeError`` to the mio std. lib.
        - Made it possible to import members from a module with: ``from foo import bar``
        
        
        mio 0.0.5 (2013-10-29)
        ......................

        - Moved the implementation of ``super`` to the mio std. lib
        - Only set ``_`` as the last result in the Root object (*the Lobby*)
        - Added support for ``()``, ``[]`` and ``{}`` special messages that can be used to define syntactic suguar for lists, dicts, etc.
        - Implemented ``Dict`` object type and ``{a=1, b=2}`` syntactic sugar to the builtint (*mio std. lib*) ``dict()`` method.
        - Refactored the ``File`` object implementation and made it's repr more consistent with other objects in mio.
        - Fixed keyword argument support.

        - Reimplemented ``not`` in the mio std. lib and added ``-=``, ``*=`` and ``/=`` operators.
        - Added a ``Object :foo`` (*primitive*) method using the ``:`` operator. This allows us to dig into the host object's internal methods.
        - Added an implementation of ``abs`` builtin using the primitive method.
        - Changed the ``import`` function to return the imported module (*instead of ``None``*) so you can bind imported modules to explicitly bound names.
        - Added ``from`` an alias to ``import`` and ``Module import`` so you can do:
        
        ::
