        mio is a minimalistic IO programming language written in the
        `Python Programming Language`_ based on MIo (*a port from Ruby to Python*)
        in the book `How To Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language`_ by
        `Marc-Andre Cournoye`_.
        
        
        Examples
        --------

            Number set("!", method(
                (self < 2) ifTrue(return self)
                return (self * ((self - 1) !))
            ))
        
        Hello World::
            
            World = Object clone
            World hello = method("Hello World!" println)

        - Homoiconic
        - Message Passing
        - Higher Order Messages
        - Higher Order Functions
        - Full support for Traits
        - Object Orienated Language

        - Supports Imperative, Functional, Object Oriented and Behavior Driven Development styles.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The simplest and recommended way to install mio is with pip.
        You may install the latest stable release from PyPI with pip::
        
            > pip install mio
        
        If you do not have pip, you may use easy_install::
        
            > easy_install mio
        
        Alternatively, you may download the source package from the
        `PyPI Page`_ or the `Downloads page`_ on the `Project Website`_;
        extract it and install using::
        
            > python setup.py install
        
        You can also install the
        `latest-development version <https://bitbucket.org/prologic/mio-lang/get/tip.tar.gz#egg=mio-dev>`_ by using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
            
            > pip install mio==dev
        
        or::
            
            > easy_install mio==dev
        
        
        For further information see the `mio documentation <http://mio-lag.readthedocs.org/>`_.

        mio 0.0.2
        ---------
        
        - Include lib as package data
        - Allow mio modules to be loaded from anywhere so mio can be more usefully run from anywhere
        - Added bool type converion
        - Improved the documentation and added docs for the grammar
        - Changed Lobby object to be called Root
        - Added an -S option (don't load system libraries).
        - Added unit test around testing for last value with return
        - Refactored Message.eval to be non-recursive
        - Set _ in the context as the last valeu
        - Implemented Blocks and Methods
        - Fixed return/state issue by implementing Object evalArg and Object evalArgAndReturnSelf in Python (not sure why this doesn't work in mio itself)
        - Implemented Object evalArgAndReturnNone
