mio 0.0.8 2013-11-07
....................

- Removed operator precedence parsing.

  - Operator precedence is **HARD**
  - Operator precedence rules hare **HARD** to remember
  - Operator precedence is not the main goal of mio right now.

- Tidied up the builtins module.
- ``from foo import *`` works again (*operator precedence parsing broke it*).


mio 0.0.7 (2013-11-06)
......................

- Added rudamentary stack trace support to errors. A somewhat "okay" stack trace is displayed on error(s).
- Added ``String format`` method for performing string iterpolation. Only supports ``{0}``, ``{1}``, etc.
- Implemented ``ListIterator`` iterable object with ``iter`` added to mio std. lib. This works similiarly to Python's iterators:

::
    
    mio> xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ===> list(1, 2, 3, 4)
    mio> it = iter(xs)
    ===> ListIterator(list(1, 2, 3, 4))
    mio> it next()
    ===> 1
    mio> it next()
    ===> 2
    mio> it next()
    ===> 3
    mio> it next()
    ===> 4
    
A further iteration would result in:

::
    
    mio> it next()

      StopIteration: 
      --------------
      next
    ifFalse(
     raise(StopIteration) 
    ) 

    raise(StopIteration) 
    
- Re-implemented ``return`` function as part of the mio std. lib.
- Don't allow ``return`` to be called outside of a ``Block`` (*block/method*) as this is illegal.
- Implemented ``while`` builtin as part of the mio std. lib.
  (*no break or continue support yet*)
- Implemented ``loop`` builtin as part of the mio std. lib.
  (*no break or continue support yet*)
- Implemented basic support for reshuffling messages before chaining to support ``x is not None`` --> ``not(x is None)``.
- Finally implemented operator precedence support (*which seems to cover most edge cases*).

.. note:: Need to write lots of unit tests for this!

- Fixed all found edge cases with the new operator precedence lexer/parser.
- Improved ``Error`` object and added ``Error catch`` method for catching errors.
- Implemented ``reduce`` builtin.
- Implemented TComparable trait
- Implemented TCloneable trait
- Iterpret ``call message args`` to mean "pass all args to the callable"
- Imroved Dict and List objects.
- Implemented ``__call__`` calling semantics whereby an object can implement this as a method and ``Foo()`` will invoke ``Foo __call__`` if it exists.
- IMplemented the ``__get__`` part of the Data Descriptor protocol.


mio 0.0.6 (2013-11-02)
......................

- Allow an optional object to be passed to the ``Object id`` method.
- Implemented ``hex`` builtin.
- Implemented ``Bytes`` and ``Tuple`` objects.
- Implemented ``State`` core object and sample ``loop`` builtin (*in testing*).
- Refactored all of the context state management code (*stopStatus*) and exposed it to the end user.

  - This means we can now write flow based constructs such as loops directly in mio.

- Fixed a minor bug in the parser where ``not(0) ifTrue(print("foo"))`` would parse as ``not(0, ifTrue(print("foo")))``
- Fixed a minor bug in the parser where ``isError`` would parse as ``is(Error)``. Parse identifiers before operators.
- Implemented basic excpetion handling and error object(s) (*no stack traces yet*).
- Moved ``exit`` to builtins.
- Moved the setting of ``.binding`` attribute to ``Object`` ``set/del`` methods.
- Added support for ``..`` operator and added this to ``Number``. This allows you to write:

::
    
    x = 1 .. 5  # a Range from 1 to 5
    
- Added ``+`` and ``-`` operators to the ``Range`` object so you can do things like:

::
    
    x = (1 .. 5) + 2  # a Range from 1 to 5 in increment of 2
    
- Changed default REPL prompt to: 

::
    
    $ mio
    mio 0.0.6.dev
    mio>
    
- Implemented ``sum`` builtin.
- Added ``try`` and ``raise`` builtins. (*``raise`` is not implemented yet...*).
- Added support for User level Error(s) and implemented ``Exception raise``
- Replaced ``Continuation call`` with activatable object semantics. This means:

::
    
    c = Continuation current()
    print("foo")
    c()
    
- ``Object evalArg`` should evaluate the argument with context as the receiver.
- Added ``List __getitem__`` and ``List __len__`` methods.
- Added ``TIterable`` trait to the mio bootstrap library and added this to ``List``.
- Removed ``foreach``, ``whilte``, ``continue``, ``break`` and ``return`` ``Object`` methods. These will be re-implemented as traits and builtins.
- Changed the way the parser parses and treats operators. They are no longer parsed in a deep right tree.

Example::
    
    1 + 2 * 3

OLD::
    
    1 +(2 *(3))
    
NEW::
    
    1 +(2) *(3)
    
- This will probably make reshuffling and therefore implementing operator precedence a lot easier.
- This also makes the following expressions possible (*used in the builtins module*):

::
    
    from foo import *
    
- Added ``TypeError``, ``KeyError`` and ``AttributeError`` to the mio std. lib.
- Made it possible to import members from a module with: ``from foo import bar``


mio 0.0.5 (2013-10-29)
......................

- Split up core into core and types.
- Re-implemented ``True``, ``False`` and ``None`` in mio.

- Implemented support for packages ala Python.
- Restructured the mio std. lib
- mio nwo bootstraps itself via an import of the "bootstrap" package.

mio 0.0.4 (*2013-10-27*)
........................

- Moved the implementation of ``super`` to the mio std. lib
- Only set ``_`` as the last result in the Root object (*the Lobby*)
- Added support for ``()``, ``[]`` and ``{}`` special messages that can be used to define syntactic suguar for lists, dicts, etc.

- Refactored the ``File`` object implementation and made it's repr more consistent with other objects in mio.
- Fixed keyword argument support.
- Fixed a few minor bugs in the ``Message`` object and improved test coverage.
- Added ``?`` as a valid operator and an implementation of ``Object ?message`` in the mio std. lib.
- Fixed a bug with ``Range``'s internal iterator causing ``Range asList`` not to work.
- Fixed a bug with ``Object foreach`` and ``continue``.
- **Achived 100% test coverage!**
- Implemented ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` support for methods and blocks.
- Removed ``Object`` methods ``print``, ``println``, ``write`` and ``writeln`` in favor of the new builtin ``print`` function in the mio std. lib

- Fixed a bug with the parser where an argument's previous attribute was not getting set correctly.
- Reimplemented ``not`` in the mio std. lib and added ``-=``, ``*=`` and ``/=`` operators.
- Added a ``Object :foo`` (*primitive*) method using the ``:`` operator. This allows us to dig into the host object's internal methods.
- Added an implementation of ``abs`` builtin using the primitive method.
- Changed the ``import`` function to return the imported module (*instead of ``None``*) so you can bind imported modules to explicitly bound names.
- Added ``from`` an alias to ``import`` and ``Module import`` so you can do:

::
    
    bar = from(foo) import(bar)
    
- Fixed some minor bugs in ``Object foreach`` and ``Object while`` where a ReturnState was not passed up to the callee.
- Added implementations of ``all`` and ``any`` to the mio std. lib.
- Added this.mio (The Zen of mio ala Zen of Python)
- Added List insert method and internal __len__.
- Moved the implementations of the ``Importer`` and ``Module`` objects to the host language (*Python*).
- Added support for modifying the ``Importer`` search path.
- Restructured the mio std. library and moved all bootstrap modules into ./lib/bootstrap
- Added (almost) Python-style string literal support. Triple Quote, Double, Quote, Single Quote, Short and Long Strings
- Added support for exponents with number literals.
- Added internal ``tomio`` and ``frommio`` type converion function.
- Added an ``FFI`` implementation that hooks directly into the host language (*Python*).
- Implemented the ``antigravity`` module in mio.
- Added support for exposing builtin functions as well in the FFI.
- Simplified the two examples used in the docs and readme and write a simple bash script to profile the factorial example.
- Changed the calling semantics so that calls to methods/blocks are explicitly made with ``()``.
- Added a new internal attribute to ``Object`` called ``binding`` used to show the binding of a bound object in repr(s).
