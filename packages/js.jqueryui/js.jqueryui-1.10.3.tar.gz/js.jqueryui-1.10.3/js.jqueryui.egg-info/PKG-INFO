        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery UI`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery UI`: http://jqueryui.com
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jqueryui``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import jQuery UI from ``js.jqueryui`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jqueryui import jqueryui
          >>> jqueryui.need()
        
        Themes
        ------
        
        The themes in the jQuery UI themes distribution are included as well::
        
          >>> from js.jqueryui import black_tie
          >>> black_tie.need()
        
        In addition to the themes provided by jQuery UI itself, an experimental
        `jQuery UI Bootstrap theme`_ is included, that makes jQuery UI widgets
        look nice in a Twitter Bootstrap themed site::
        
          >>> from js.jqueryui import bootstrap
          >>> bootstrap.need()
        
        Locales
        -------
        
        Also included are locales for the jQuery UI datepicker.
        
        How to get the right locale for the current request depends on your web framework.
        In `Pyramid`_ you could e.g. do something like this::
        
            from js.jqueryui import ui_datepicker_locales
            from pyramid.i18n import get_locale_name
        
            locale_name = get_locale_name(request)
            if locale_name in ui_datepicker_locales:
                ui_datepicker_locales[locale_name].need()
