js.jqueryui
***********

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery UI`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery UI`: http://jqueryui.com

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jqueryui``) are published to some URL.
