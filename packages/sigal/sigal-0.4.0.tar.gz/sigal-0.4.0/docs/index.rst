=======================================
Sigal - Simple Static Gallery Generator
=======================================

Sigal is yet another simple static gallery generator. It's written in Python
and it allows to build a static gallery of images with the following features:

* Process directories recursively.
* Generate HTML pages using jinja2 templates.
* Relative links for a portable output.
* Themes support.
* MIT licensed.

The idea behind Sigal is to ease the use of the javascript librairies like
`galleria`_. These librairies do a great job to display the images, Sigal does
what is missing: resize images, create thumbnails, generate html pages.

Sigal is currently compatible only with python 2.

Themes & Demo
-------------

Sigal comes with two themes, based on the `colorbox`_ and `galleria`_
Javascript libraries:

- `colorbox demo`_
- `galleria demo`_

.. _galleria: http://galleria.io/
.. _colorbox: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox
.. _galleria demo: http://saimon.org/sigal-demo/galleria/
.. _colorbox demo: http://saimon.org/sigal-demo/colorbox/


Installation
------------

Install the extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install sigal

or alternatively if you have pip installed::

    $ pip install sigal

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Argh
- Clint
- Jinja2
- Pilkit
- Python Imaging Library (PIL / Pillow)
- Python Markdown


How to Use
----------

Init
  To get started, just run ``sigal init`` which will copy an example
  configuration file in the current directory. All configuration values have a
  default; values that are commented out serve to show the default. Default
  values are specified when modified in this example config file.

Build
  After adapting the configuration to your needs, put your images in a
  sub-directory and run ``sigal build <your images directory>``. The next time
  you run ``sigal build``, only the new images will be processed. Use the
  ``-f`` flag to force the reprocessing of all the images.

Serve
  To visualize your gallery, you can use ``sigal serve`` which runs a basic
  web server. This server should only be used for local browsing, not in
  production. Another option is to use the ``index_in_url = True`` setting,
  which will add ``index.html`` to the urls to allow browsing without a
  server.


Help of the ``sigal build`` command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ sigal build [-h] [-d] [-v] [-f] [-c CONFIG] [-t THEME]
            [source] [destination]

Required arguments:

``source``
  Input directory

``destination``
  Output directory (default: ``_build/``)

Optional arguments:

``-h, --help``
  Show this help message and exit

``-f, --force``
  Force the reprocessing of existing images and thumbnails

``-v, --verbose``
  Show all messages

``-d, --debug``
  Show all message, including debug messages

``-c CONFIG, --config CONFIG``
  Configuration file (default: ``sigal.conf.py`` in the current working
  directory)

``-t THEME, --theme THEME``
  Specify a theme directory, or a theme name for the themes included with Sigal


Configuration
-------------

The configuration must be set in a ``sigal.conf.py`` file in the current
directory. It can also be specified with the ``-c`` flag. An example file with
explanations on the settings is available in ``sigal/templates/sigal.conf.py``
and is shown below. This file is copied to the current directory with the
``sigal init`` commmand.

.. literalinclude:: ../sigal/templates/sigal.conf.py
   :language: python


Album information
-----------------

Information on an album can be given in a file using the `markdown`_ syntax,
named ``index.md`` :

::

    Title: Another example gallery
    Thumbnail: test2.jpg

    And a description with *Markdown* syntax.

Some meta-data keys are used by Sigal to get the useful informations on the
gallery:

- *Title*: the gallery title.
- *Thumbnail*: the thumbnail that will be used in the parent directory to
  represent the gallery.

Any additional meta-data is available in the templates. For instance::

    Authors: Waylan Limberg
             John Doe

can be used in the template with:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% if 'authors' in meta %}
    <p>Authors: {{ meta.authors|join(', ') }}</>
    {% endif %}

If this file does not exist or if some meta-data is missing:

- The directory's name is used for the title (dashes and underscores are
  replaced with spaces).
- The first image of the directory is used as thumbnail.
