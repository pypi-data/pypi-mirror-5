Bitmask is the multiplatform desktop client for the LEAP Platform.
The LEAP Encryption Access Project develops a multi-year plan to secure everyday communication.
 The Encrypted Internet Proxy (EIP) provides circumvention, location anonymization, and traffic encryption in a hassle-free, automatically self-configuring fashion.
Encrypted Mail offers automatic encryption and decryption for both outgoing and incoming email, adding public key cryptography to your mail without you ever having to worry about key distribution or signature verification. 
The Encrypted Mail services will run local SMTP and IMAP proxies that, once you configure the mail client of your choice, will automatically encrypt and decrypt your email using GPG encryption under the hood.
