Welcome to Blacktie!
==========================

This package is functional but under heavy development so you may want to periodically
pull the latest code from the repo at git://github.com/xguse/blacktie.git.

For the **LATEST** version pull the 'develop' branch.

**I seek collaboration and contributions to improve this tool.**  

**PLEASE** take it and run with it, but send me your progress!

Its goal is to **simplify the integration of all the
input/output streams of the tophat/cufflinks workflow** into a single yaml based config
file and automate as much of everything else as possible so that once the config file
is filled out, **the entire process of analysing a multi-condition RNA-seq experiment can
be run with a single command.**  

I have not had time to fill in ALL the doc strings but updating them regularly.

(Current version of the docs can be found here: http://xguse.github.com/blacktie/)

If you want to use/contribute before the docs are complete, please feel free to contact me at 
wadunn83@gmail.com for guidance.

Usage
-----
::

  usage: blacktie [-h] [--prog {tophat,cufflinks,cuffmerge,cuffdiff,all}]
		  [--hide-logs] [--mode {analyze,dry_run,qsub_script}]
		  config_file

  This script reads options from a yaml formatted file and organizes the
  execution of tophat/cufflinks runs for multiple condition sets.

  positional arguments:
    config_file           Path to a yaml formatted config file containing setup
			  options for the runs.

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --prog {tophat,cufflinks,cuffmerge,cuffdiff,all}
			  Which program do you want to run? (default: tophat)
    --hide-logs           Make your log directories hidden to keep a tidy
			  'looking' base directory. (default: False)
    --mode {analyze,dry_run,qsub_script}
			  1) 'analyze': run the analysis pipeline. 2) 'dry_run':
			  walk through all steps that would be run and print out
			  the command lines; however, do not send the commands
			  to the system to be run. 3) 'qsub_script': generate
			  bash scripts suitable to be sent to a compute
			  cluster's SGE through the qsub command. (default:
			  analyze)
