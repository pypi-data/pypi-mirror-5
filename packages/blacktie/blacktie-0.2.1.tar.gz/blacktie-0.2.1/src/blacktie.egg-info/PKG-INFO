Description: Welcome to Blacktie!
        ==========================
        
        This package is functional but under heavy development so you may want to periodically
        pull the latest code from the repo at git://github.com/xguse/blacktie.git.
        
        For the **LATEST** version pull the 'develop' branch.
        
        **I seek collaboration and contributions to improve this tool.**  
        
        **PLEASE** take it and run with it, but send me your progress!
        
        Its goal is to **simplify the integration of all the
        input/output streams of the tophat/cufflinks workflow** into a single yaml based config
        file and automate as much of everything else as possible so that once the config file
        is filled out, **the entire process of analysing a multi-condition RNA-seq experiment can
        be run with a single command.**  
        
        I have not had time to fill in ALL the doc strings but updating them regularly.
        
        (Current version of the docs can be found here: http://xguse.github.com/blacktie/)
        
        If you want to use/contribute before the docs are complete, please feel free to contact me at 
        wadunn83@gmail.com for guidance.

        Usage
        -----
        ::
        
          usage: blacktie [-h] [--prog {tophat,cufflinks,cuffmerge,cuffdiff,all}]
        		  [--hide-logs] [--mode {analyze,dry_run,qsub_script}]
        		  config_file
        
          This script reads options from a yaml formatted file and organizes the
          execution of tophat/cufflinks runs for multiple condition sets.
        
          positional arguments:
            config_file           Path to a yaml formatted config file containing setup
        			  options for the runs.
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            --prog {tophat,cufflinks,cuffmerge,cuffdiff,all}
        			  Which program do you want to run? (default: tophat)
            --hide-logs           Make your log directories hidden to keep a tidy
        			  'looking' base directory. (default: False)
            --mode {analyze,dry_run,qsub_script}
        			  1) 'analyze': run the analysis pipeline. 2) 'dry_run':
        			  walk through all steps that would be run and print out
        			  the command lines; however, do not send the commands
        			  to the system to be run. 3) 'qsub_script': generate
        			  bash scripts suitable to be sent to a compute
        			  cluster's SGE through the qsub command. (default:
        			  analyze)

        * added new class in calls.py CummerbundCall to use blacktie-cummerbund script to add cummeRbund plots to blacktie script
        * checks for R and rpy2 installations
        * if cummeRbund R library not found, it walks you through installing it
        * ``src/blacktie/utils/calls.py``: - fixed _flag_out_dir() so that if the outdir has not been created yet it gracefully moves on
        * ``examples/blacktie_config_example.yaml``: - added cummerbund_options
        * ``requirements.txt``: - added rpy2
        * updated docs

        * git tag: 'v0.2.0rc1'
        * Added support for handling biological replicates in cuffdiff runs.
        * Major changes to yaml config:
            * condition_queue[index].group_id --> condition_queue[index].experiment_id
            * addition of condition_queue[index].replicate_id to track replicate data
            * condition_queue[index].name now represents description of an 'experiemental condition' and will be shared by replicates.
