Introduction
============

This library packages `BlocksIt.js`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of
BlocksIt.js's structure and different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`blocksit`: http://www.inwebson.com/jquery/blocksit-js-dynamic-grid-layout-jquery-plugin/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.blocksit``) are published to some URL.
