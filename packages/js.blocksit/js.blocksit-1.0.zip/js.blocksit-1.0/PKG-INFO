        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `BlocksIt.js`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of
        BlocksIt.js's structure and different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`blocksit`: http://www.inwebson.com/jquery/blocksit-js-dynamic-grid-layout-jquery-plugin/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.blocksit``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import blocksit from ``js.blocksit`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.blocksit import blocksit
          >>> blocksit.need()
