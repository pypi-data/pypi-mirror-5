        *Simpact Purple* is a module for agent-based simulations of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and is part of a suite of HIV modeling tools known as *Simpact*. It is a useful tool for public health officials and epidemiologists which implements a parallelized algorithm based on queue theory. Typical usage::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            import Simpact
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                s = Simpact.Simpact()
        	s.INITIAL_POPULATION = 1000
        	s.run()
