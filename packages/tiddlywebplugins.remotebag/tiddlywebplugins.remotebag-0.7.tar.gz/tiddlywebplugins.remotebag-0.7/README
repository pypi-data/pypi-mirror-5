A TiddlyWeb plugin that provides access to remote content as if it were a bag.

The general purpose is to allow a recipe to contain a URI where a
bag name would normally go. If that URI is a remote TiddlyWeb bag
then the stuff on the end of the URI will be treated as JSON tiddlers.
Otherwise adaptor mechanisms can be coded in to process the content.
If there is no adaptor mechanism, then the stuff on the end is treated
as containing a single tiddler with type whatever the content-type of
the resource is.

This is highly experimental stuff, and as currently formed results
in an open proxy on the TiddlyWeb server that uses it.

Only publically available content is usable through this process.
