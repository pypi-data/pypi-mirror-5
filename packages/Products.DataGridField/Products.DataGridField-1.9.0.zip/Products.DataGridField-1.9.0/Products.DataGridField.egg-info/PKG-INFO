Description: DataGridField
        =============
        
        Released under the GNU General Public License
        
        A table input component for Plone. Uses Javascript to make entering tabular data more user friendly process -
        there are no round trip HTTP requests to the server when inserting or deleting rows.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        	o Any number of columns set by a developer
        
        	o Any number of rows filled by a user
        
        	o Insert and deleting rows without submitting a form
        
        	o Many different column types
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        	o Plone 4 (for Plone 3, use the latest release in the 1.7 branch or 1.6 branch, for Plone 2.5, use the latest release in the 1.6 branch)
        
        	o A browser with Javascript support. There isn't yet graceful degradation for
        	  browsers without Javascript.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This version of DataGridField is distributed as an
        egg at the Python Package index.  Information about configuring either for a zope instance
        house a Plone site can be found by reading the `Installing an Add-on Product`_
        tutorial and the "Installing a third party product" section of the `Managing Project with zc.buildout`_ tutorial.
        
        .. _Installing an Add-on Product: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/third-party-products
        .. _Managing Project with zc.buildout: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/buildout/installing-a-third-party-product
        
        Once you've succesfully done this, you can use the Add/Remove Products screen to install the DataGridField into your
        site. See below for information about experimenting with the demo types.
        
        
        Quality
        -------
        
        	o Tested with Firefox 2.0, IE 6, IE 7
        
        
        Usage examples
        --------------
        
        Simple example with three free text columns::
        
                schema = BaseSchema + Schema((
        
                DataGridField('DemoField',
                        widget = DataGridWidget(),
                        columns=('column1','column2','The third')
                        ),
                ))
        
        Complex example with different column types and user friendly labels::
        
        	# Plone imports
        	from Products.Archetypes.public import DisplayList
        	from Products.Archetypes.public import *
        
        	# Local imports
        	from Products.DataGridField import DataGridField, DataGridWidget
        	from Products.DataGridField.Column import Column
        	from Products.DataGridField.SelectColumn import SelectColumn
        
        	class DataGridDemoType(BaseContent):
        	    """A simple archetype
        
        	    """
        
        	    schema = BaseSchema + Schema((
        	        DataGridField('DemoField',
        	                searchable = True,
        	                columns=("column1", "column2", "select_sample"),
        	                widget = DataGridWidget(
        	                    columns={
        	                        'column1' : Column("Toholampi city rox"),
        	                        'column2' : Column("My friendly name"),
        	                        'select_sample' : SelectColumn("Friendly name", vocabulary="getSampleVocabulary")
        	                    },
        	                 ),
        	         ),
        
        	        ))
        
        	    def getSampleVocabulary(self):
        	        """
        	        """
        	        """ Get list of possible taggable features from ATVocabularyManager """
        	        return DisplayList(
        
        	            (("sample", "Sample value 1",),
        	            ("sample2", "Sample value 2",),))
        
        For more examples, see unit test code.
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        	o Since DataGridField 1.5, if you wish to retain old way of automatic row inserting.
        	  Here is a bit logic behind all this - otherwise there will be an extra row
        	  added when you edit DGF and press save.
        
        		o You must set property auto_insert = True to DataGridWidget
        
        		o You must set property allow_empty_rows = False to DataGridField
        
        
        Known bugs
        ----------
        
        	o Sometimes on Firefox column sizes start changing after the user enters some
        	  data. Not sure if this is a Firefox bug, though.
        
        	o Prefilled default values work only for text and select columns
        
        	o Radio button and link column postback is not handled properly. This needs
        	  fixes very deep into Zope (ZPublisher). If the form validation fails,
        	  link column and radio button columns lost their values.
        
        
        Demo
        ----
        
        A demo type is included. It is disabled by default. This type is neither pretty nor very functional,
        but demonstrates how a data grid should be used. You can install this type into your site by
        running the "DataGridField (Example DGF content types)" from the Generic Setup tool within the ZMI.

          or keywords arguments.

        ------------------
        
        - Fixed Unauthorized error in queryDataGrid when the aq_parent of an
          object is private, even when we do not actually need any info from

        - Added support for Spanish localization
          [macagua]

        ------------------
        
        - Fixed possible TypeError when submitting the base_metadata form.
          [maurits]
        
        - In the view macro use the supplied accessor instead of thinking we
          know how to get the accessor ourselves as that gives wrong results
          with LinguaPlone.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/datagridfield/issues/14
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed tests for Plone 4, including a good cleanup.
          [maurits]
        
        - Adaptation to work on Plone 4/Zope 2.12.
          For Plone 3, please use the 1.7 or 1.6 branches.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.7 (unreleased)
        ----------------
        
        - When there is an empty row with the template_row_marker and
          validation fails (for any field), make sure we do not end up with
          *two* empty rows.
          [maurits+vpretre]
        
        - added LinesColumn (used as custom vocabulary source in PFGDataGrid field)
          [naro]
        
        - added unique column classnames for thead and tbody table section to identify
          columns and modify it's properties through css (specially width for each
          column seperatly). Now we can remove the style attributes and do some
          template code cleanup.  [saily]
        
        - allow Products.Archetypes.interfaces.IVocabulary providing objects as
          Vocabularies. This makes SelectColumn usable in archetypes.schemaextender
          w/o having to patch the extended class.
          [jensens]
        
        - Move installation back to GenericSetup, end of Plone 2.5.x support
          [andrewb, but real thanks goes to wichert]
        
        
        1.6 (2009-01-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Merging of colliding datagridwidget.css and datagridwidget.css.dtml files.
          Fixes issue #30: http://plone.org/products/datagridfield/issues/30.  Which
          file was ultimately selected appears to be inconsistent.  If you're
          depending upon an overridden version of either and notice bugs with regards
          to hidden columns and/or rows appearing or the promise of adding additional
          DGF rows when using the FixedColumn, you'd be well suited to reconcile your
          customizations with the merged files from r10445 at:
          http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/10445
          [andrewb]
        
        
        1.6rc1
        ------
        
        - Adding Plone 2.5.x DataGridField profile "default_25x" to overcome difference in
          GS namespace for the registration of our skin directory.  Without this, one needed
          to manually add the correct FSDV within the portal_skins tool for .pt, .dtml,
          images, etc. to exist with the DataGridWidget's skins directory. [andrewb]
        
        - Adding back Extensions and Install.py with install() function for consistent
          Add/Remove Products experience back to Plone 2.5.x, which did not handle
          GenericSetup profile-based installation.  The install code delegates to Generic
          Setup for maximal code reuse. The justification is that to completely remove
          a Add/Remove Product support in Plone 2.5.x between a beta 2 and beta 3 release
          is overly extreme.  This will workaround will be rectified in a future release. [andrewb]
        
          Note: This was added manually without history because the the eggified version
          of DataGridField was moved, rather than copied, thus no history at:
          http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/log/Products.DataGridField?action=follow_copy&rev=&stop_rev=&mode=follow_copy
        
        - Updated installation instructions, info about example types, and added note about ceasing
          Plone 2.5.x support [andrewb]
        
        - Removed check of "@@plone_lock_info" within example types' GS declarations,
          so actions render in pre-Plone locking era [andrewb]
        
        - Made all tests pass in Plone 2.5.x, 3.0.x, and 3.1.x [andrewb]
        
        - Made explicit names for the different GS profiles that one might choose
          to install within portal_setup [andrewb]
        
        
        1.6 beta 3
        ----------
        
        - Eggified in Products.AddRemoveWidget
          [SteveM]
        
        - Register skin layer correctly.
          [maurits]
        
        - Move installation to GenericSetup.
          [wichert]
        
        - Removed lots and lots of unneeded import. Pyflakes found that Plone 2.1
          support has been broken for a while, so stop claiming it's still supported.
          [wichert]
        
        - Added validator isDataGridFilled (copied from Poi, where it can
          later be removed).  Use this as validator on a DataGridField if you
          want it to have at least one entry: currently a bogus/hidden entry
          always remains even when you remove all real entries, so making a
          DataGridField required has no real effect.
          See http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/139 and 160.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.6 beta 2
        ----------
        
        - Disabled INSTALL_DEMO_TYPES from config.py.
          [andrewburkhalter]
        
        
        1.5
        ---
        
        - Pop-up help column by Juan Grigera
        
        - Added CheckboxColumn by Radim Novotny
        
        - Plone 3.0 compatible (fixed CMFCorePermissions import)
        
        - Fixed http://plone.org/products/datagridfield/issues/16 (applied the patch)
        
        - DataGridField has new property allow_oddeven. Setting this to True will highlight
          odd end even rows in the view/edit tables. Default: False
        
        - FixedColumn has optional parameter "visible" (default True). Setting this to False
          will hide (using css) column from both - view and edit forms.
        
        
        1.5rc3
        ------
        
        - Added CheckboxColumn. Implementation based on RadioColumn, so there are same bugs.
          CheckboxColumn lose values if any field on the form raises validation error.
          Be aware of that, better does not use CheckboxColumn in forms with required fields
          or fields with validators.
          [Contributor: naro, radim novotny]
        
        
        1.5rc2
        ------
        
        - Fixed row adding in IE. This was one of the most horrible debugging session
          I have had. There was some obscure IE bug which prevented making a DOM
          node orignally hidden to visible. I created "hacky" workaround for this.
          Tested in IE 6.0 and FF 1.5.
        
        - Wolfram Fenske's I18N patch is disabled, since it doesn't work in Plone 2.5.
          The code is almost there. If someone wants to make it complete, it shouldn't
          take too much time.
        
        
        1.5rc1
        ------
        
        - Added workaround for bad DGF initializing which caused empty rows when DGF was created
          programmatically
        
        
        1.0 to 1.5
        ----------
        
        - Plone 2.5 compatibility guaranteed
        
        - DGF row manipulators rewritten. Automatically adding new rows feature is
          now optional, thus making it possible for columns to have prefilled
          default values without creating a mess. Disabling auto insert is necessary
          for columns like SelectWidget which don't have empty default values.
        
        - Refactored page template code to be more easily extendable. Now CSS file
          is used for styling DataGridWidgets.
        
        - New column type: Link column
        
        - (Wolfram Fenske) I18N patch
        
          Archetypes widgets have an attribute i18n_domain, which is used to
          determine which message catalog to use for translation. In
          DataGridField, this attribute is ignored.
        
          I have attached a small patch (in fact, smaller than this bug report)
          which fixes these problems. I didn't want to introduce a lot of new
          code, so I did the translation of the labels in the Column class, not
          in the page template, which might also have been a good way to do it.
          Since the functions "getLabel()" and "getColumnLabels()" are only
          called by the page template anyway, I believe this is not an issue.
          But if you'd rather translate the labels in the page template, please
          let me know and I'll write a different patch.
        
        - (Juan Grigera) Marshaller patch
        
          I enjoyed your DataGriedField/Widget product for Plone, and would like
          to contributea small patch/bugfix. In the field mutator (set) the
          passed value is not always a record, but sometimes a string.
          In fact the RFC822Marshaller passes a string.
