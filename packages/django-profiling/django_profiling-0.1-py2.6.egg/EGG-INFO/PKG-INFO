        Usage
        =====
        
        Install into your Django Python environment using your favorite tool.
        Add `dprofiling` to your list of installed Django applications. Add 
        `dprofiling.middleware.ProfileRequestMiddleware` to the top of you
        middleware list. You can place it lower in the stack of middleware if
        you do not want to profile your middleware in addition to the view.
