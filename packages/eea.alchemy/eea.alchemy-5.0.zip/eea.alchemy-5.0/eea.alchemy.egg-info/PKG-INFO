        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Auto discover keywords, location or temporal coverage
        -----------------------------------------------------
        
        1. Get your alchemy key here: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html
        2. Update your alchemy API key within Site Setup > Alchemy Settings
        3. Within Plone Control panel go to Alchemy Discoverer.
        
        Auto tagging
        ------------
        
        1. *Enable auto-tagging* within **Site Setup > Alchemy Settings**
        2. Edit your document and add some tags for it within **/edit > Categorization.**
           For example, if you're writing a news article about *water pollution* go to
           **/edit > Categorization** and add *water pollution* within tags field
           (also known as *keywords*, *subjects*, *topics*).
           Now when you navigate to the **View** page of this article,
           you'll notice that all occurrences of *water pollution* within your news
           article body are links to a custom search page which is also configurable
           within **Alchemy Settings ControlPanel**
