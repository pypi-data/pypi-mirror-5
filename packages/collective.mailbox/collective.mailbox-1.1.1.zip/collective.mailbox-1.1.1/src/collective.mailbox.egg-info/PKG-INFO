        Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a MailHost that stores all mail, if it is from or to a registered user.
        It's very primitive now, I expect it to to grow fratures like purging etc in
        the future, but at the moment there is none.
        
        After installing it through the Plone Control Panel Addons as usual, all sent
        emails that are sent to or from a registered user will be stored. Each user
        can se his in and out-box at the http://plonesite/@@my_mailbox URL.
