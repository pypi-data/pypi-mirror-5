        If the target of the AttachFS PUT is a project then we need to
        determine what folder in the project should be.  The basic default
        is just to use the root folder - the server by default has no
        understanding of the folder structure within a problem.  Alternatively
        a server-wide fault "ProjectINBOXFolderPath" can be set, this will try
        to drive uploaded documents into the specified path.  For example if
        the "ProjectINBOXFolderPath" is set to a value of "INBOX" then uploads
        will be directed to the project folder "/INBOX". Upon upload this
        folder will be created (permissions permitting) if it does not exist.
        Above and beyond the server default an object property may be set on
        the project to specicially control the upload folder for just that
        project.

            {57c7fc84-3cea-417d-af54-b659eb87a046}inboxPath = "myProjectsInbox"

        Also within the INBOX a subfolder can be created based upon the upload
        target; this can isolate documents uploaded for each task, for example.
        [Uploads to tasks 'bounce' into their associated projects].  This is
        controlled server-side via a server default named
        ProjectINBOXSubdirEnabled; if this default is YES then INBOX
        subfoldering is enabled.  Specific projects can toggle subfoldering on
        and off using an object property in the Coils namespace named
        useINBOXSubfolders.  If the indicated subfolder does not exist and
        subfolder mode is enabled the folder will be created [permissions
        permitting].
