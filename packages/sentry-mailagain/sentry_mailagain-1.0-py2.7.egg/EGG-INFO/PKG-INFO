        ================
        
        sentry-mailagain is a Sentry plugin to resend the mail notification on
        receiving new events in an unresolved group. The mail notification will be
        handled in the same manner as would a regression.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        > pip install sentry-mailagain
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Configuration is per-project, and has one setting: You may configure how long
        the plugin should wait before treating new events for a group as needing a new
        notification.
