Description: Statpipe
        =============
        
        
        Statpipe is a simple command line utility allowing stata commands to be piped into
        Stata on OSX, and the output returned.
        
        For example:
        
            echo "di 2^2" | statpipe
            . di 2^2
            4
        
        You can also use in interactive mode (although state isn't saved across calculations):
        
        	statpipe
        	> Enter a stata expression (e.g. di 2*2):
        	di 2*2
        	> Cached output re-used
        	> . di 2*2
        	> 4
        	
        
        To install, download and:
        
        	cd statpipe
        	python setup.py install #you might need to sudo if installing in system python
        	
        or
        
        	pip install statpipe
