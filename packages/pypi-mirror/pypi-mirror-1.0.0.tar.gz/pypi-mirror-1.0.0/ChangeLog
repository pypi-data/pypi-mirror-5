    Replace spaces with -'s
    
    On Centos, the lsb_release returns the text on one line. To solve that,
    we need to replace not just newlines, but also spaces in the output
    to match what lsb_release -i -r -s | xargs | tr ' ' '-' will do.

    Don't use wheel when constructing the base mirror
    
    Clients of the mirror may need to fall back on non-wheel files,
    and if an upstream project has published wheels, then the mirror
    will be missing those in the non-wheel portion. Additionally,
    use-wheel given to the wheel command will cause transitive depends
    to be skipped in the local wheelhouse.
    
    The only thing that should be making/injecting wheels is the wheel
    creation portion of things.

    Don't upgrade setuptools or distribute
    
    It turns out that upgrading setuptools and distribute in the venv
    we use to build the mirror causes MySQL-python to error out. However,
    as of virtualenv 1.10.1, there's a new enough version of pip (1.4)
    so it's actually not necessary for us to explicitly upgrade.

    Add distribute to the pre-install list
    
    mysql-python is crapping the fantastic bong because of a continued
    reliance on distribute. Fine. We'll just make sure we have latest
    no-op package in our virtualenv so that epic fail stops killing bunnies.
    
    Also, when we're running the wheel command in our venvs, we kinda need
    wheel to be installed in them.

    Start building wheels in the mirror
    
    The mirror should build wheels, because they're awesome. However, because
    the wheel format does not do fine-grained enough selection on
    things like the high likelihood that Ubuntu precise and Ubuntu raring
    might have different underlying C libraries for python 2.7, we need to
    put our built wheels into a structure that allows them to be used
    safely.
    
    lsb_release -r -i is used because Centos lists lsb_release -c as "Final"
    which is not particularly helpful. This will wind up with identifying
    strings like Ubuntu-12.04 and Centos-6.4 - which should be good enough
    for what we need. A call to a shell is used so that the same logic can
    be easily duplicated in select-mirror, which is shell, to produce the
    appropriate pip.conf file.

    Improving Gerrit + commit-log automation.
    
    I've reworked a few items here, so I will describe them in as much a
    linear fashion as possible. Keep in mind that one of the primary goals
    for these changes is to allow us to "trigger more magic from Gerrit".
    And it is to that end that I've implemented these changes.
    
    In find_bugs(), I've tightened-up the regular expression being used so
    that it will parse-out any prefixes associated with the bug reference.
    I've tested the regular expression against the most common bug
    references that I've seen in commit logs, as well as against the
    styles described in our documentation. The sources that I've drawn
    from are:
    
        https://etherpad.openstack.org/drive-automation-from-commitmsg
        https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages
        https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Gerrit_Workflow
    
    Moreover, I'm using re.finditer() which allows for more direct
    access to the text that was matched. Lastly, I've tried to keep the
    expression as flexible as possible so that it will match even if the
    developer references the bug in a funky way.
    
    In order to keep the prefix and lp_task associated with each other,
    I've created a class called "Task" which is simply an interface to
    determine what sort of automation needs to take place for the given
    bugtask. This being the case, I've taken the liberty of renaming a few
    variables to make this more clear.
    
    In "Task", a basic level of processing is performed on the prefix to
    determine what changes need to be made on launchpad. A method called
    needs_change() returns a boolean indicating if the supplied argument
    is a change which needs to be made.
    
    Lastly, yet most importantly for this bug fix, process_bugtsk() is
    utilizing needs_change(), as mentioned above, to ensure that the
    bugtask's status is not erroneously changed in the case of a bug fix
    which spans multiple commits.

    Be more agressive trying to install requirements.
    
    When -r requirements.txt is used, either then entire file works
    or the entire file doesn't. This means that if there is a hiccup
    with any of the files, we lose the entire run instead of just
    the one file.
    
    By iterating over the list and installing as many as we can, then
    processing the freeze, we get as many of them as we can.
    
    This is especially helpful when combined with the upcoming pbr/jeepyb
    gate, where the lack of a requirement in the gate will show up when
    the thing that needs it can't install it. If we get everything else,
    the error message in that case will be much more clear as to why.

    Makes Impact bug creation generic, ceases doc spam
    
    This patch moves the bug creation code to its own method, so that it
    can be used by other kinds of impacts.
    
    It also changes the notification logic for DocImpact, so that emails
    are now only sent if bug creation was not successful.

    Fix docimpact bug generation code
    
    My sincere apologies to the infra team.
    
    The original code to create bugs from DocImpact itself suffered
    from a bug - it was trying to refer to an email address rather than
    an impact line. Luckily, due to the design, this had no impact on
     sending Impact emails for security or docs.
    
    This change correctly checks for docimpact prior to bug creation.

Date:   Mon Jun 10 11:04:16 2013 +1000

    autogenerate doc bug reports based on DocImpact tag
    
    DocImpact has worked well for communicating new features and code
    changes that impact documentation to the doc team. However, the bulk
    of the emails received were essentially just turned into bug reports.
    This change allows the automated creation of those bug reports.
    
    The code searches for potential duplicate bugs before creating a bug
    to avoid creating multiple bugs per review.
    
    Note that this is originally the page from
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30718/
    
    However, I'm drowning in DocImpact emails and wanted to move things
    along while the original author (Steven Deaton) is on holiday.
    
    There is potential future work here to:
    1) alter the text on bug update
    2) close bugs associated with abandoned patch sets
    3) mark patch-merged bugs as 'confirmed'
    
    though, as one of the main benefactors from this code, I am quite
    happy to put this forward without these extras initially if it is
    acceptable to our awesome infra team :)
    
    patchset 2 updates documentation strings thanks to excellent feedback :)

    Ability to run cmd scripts directly.
    
    Add a conditional check to call main() in cmd scripts if they're
    being invoked directly. Some already had them, but most simply
    relied on the entrypoints wrappers declared in setup.py. With this
    change, users can more easily test and debug the various command
    scripts directly without needing setup magic.

    Edited the parsed url to work.
    
    There was duplication in the parsed url, I removed the duplication
    to get the url to work.
    
    I commented out the swift heading in the ini file so that the
    absence-of-swift conditionals were met in the script.
    
    I set the output_mode to multiple since that was the setting that I
    got to work for me so I thought having a working ini file was a good
    idea.

    Stop using pypi mirrors to build our mirror.
    
    Pypi mirrors tend to be out of date which is annoying when we need to
    updated our mirror to include the latest version of a particular package
    (eg one of the OpenStack python clients). The pip -M option won't always
    see the latest version when talking to the pypi mirrors. To avoid this
    problem don't use pip -M and talk to pypi directly.

    manage_projects.py was running `git diff-index --quiet HEAD --`
    previously to check if project.config had changed. This apparently
    returns an exit code of 1 in some cases where a diff was not expected.
    Switch to using `git diff --quiet HEAD` to check if any differences are
    found. This appears to be more reliable in some manual testing.

    Attempt to more fully manage project creation.
    
    Manage project creation via yaml files. Also,
    Modify the manage_projects scripts to configure Gerrit project ACLs.
    This change expects the project yaml to exist. The change will clone the
    project for the localhost Gerrit install. It will then checkout the
    meta/config ref, copy the ACL config file into the repo, commit, and
    push to the origin. The ACL config location should be specified in the
    projects.yaml file with the acl_config key.
    
    For this to work the ACLs will need to be copied by Puppet from Puppet
    to the Gerrit host. Add the file resource to do this as well.

    let's only indicate 'has-pull-requests' if there is ever a project for whom
    we do not want to close pull requests.

Author: Monty Taylor <mordred@inaugust.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 29 12:54:27 2012 -0500

    Add support for initial project creation.
    
    If replicate_local is set, this will ensure that /var/lib/git is created,
    and that projects listed in the projects.config have repos there.
    
    Additionally, it creates a new config file, projects.config which is a
    yaml file listing all of the projects and various operational semantics about
    them, such as whether or not they should have pull requests closed and whether
    or not they track any remotes. This replaces remotes.config and github.config.
    
    Moving forward, there is no reason to not have this script be able to
    do github api calls to create the github repo if it's not there, set the
    github project description, gerrit api calls to create the project in gerrit,
    and initial project permissions templates.

    Broke launchpad user sync into its own class.
    
    Additionally, the file installation of the scripts wasn't working,
    so the sync script wasn't actually getting installed. This moves
    the underlying scripts to be installed by the gerrit module,
    because it owns /usr/local/gerrit/scripts, and then manages the
    gerrit hooks which call those scripts in the openstack_project
    class, since that's where the config choice to enable those
    functions really should live.

    Compress database backups.
    
    Fixes bug 951600.
    
    The update_gerrit_users.py script creates a database backup
    everytime it runs. This change compresses the backups as they
    are being made and adds a cron job that will remove backups that
    are 30 days or older. Current backups will need to be manually
    compressed.

    Move gerrit scripts to puppet.
    
    Take the things from openstack-ci/gerrit and move them directly
    in to the puppet module. Install them using the model we're using
    for the jenkins slave scripts.

    Move gerrit scripts into puppet module
    
    Moving the cron executed gerrit scripts into the puppet module.  This is for two reasons:
    
    1. Easier/faster to deploy/maintain than having a cron job for a separate git repo
    2. We can add customisations required for review-dev and stackforge
