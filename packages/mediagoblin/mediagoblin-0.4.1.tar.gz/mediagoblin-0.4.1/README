What is GNU MediaGoblin?
========================

* Initially, a place to store all your photos that’s as awesome as, if
  not more awesome than, existing network services (Flickr, SmugMug,
  Picasa, etc)
* Customizable!
* A place for people to collaborate and show off original and derived
  creations.  Free, as in freedom.  We’re a GNU project after all.
* Later, a place for all sorts of media, such as video, music, etc hosting.
* Later, federated with OStatus!


Is it ready for me to use?
==========================

Yes!  But with caveats.  The software is usable and there are instances
running, but it's still in its early stages.


Can I help/hang out/participate/whisper sweet nothings in your ear?
===================================================================

Yes!  Please join us and hang out!  For more information on where we
hang out, see `our Join page <http://mediagoblin.org/join/>`_


Where is the documentation?
===========================

directory in HTML, Texinfo, and source (Restructured Text) forms.  It's
also available online at http://docs.mediagoblin.org/ in HTML form.
