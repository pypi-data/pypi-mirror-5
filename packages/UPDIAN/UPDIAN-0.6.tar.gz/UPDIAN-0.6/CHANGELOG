Updian

Minimalistic package upgrade tool with web frontend by Robert Klikics, RobHost GmbH [rk@robhost.de], 2007-2013

v0.6

- rewrote all functionality in python
- removed multi-ssh functionality (because there are dedicated tools like multissh or clusterssh)
- added HTTP basic authentication directly to UPDIAN so a webserver is not needed anymore
- changed configuration format to ini-like format (use 'updiancmd init_cfg' to create an example configuration)

v0.5

- change serverlist format from CSV to JSON

v0.4

- basic yum support added
- bugfixes

v0.3

- other SSH ports then 22 can be set (hostname:port in server list)
- serverlist, queue and logs are now sorted
- polished (a litte bit^^) interface (table-view and such things)
- if you've installed "debian-goodies" package on remote server updian now checks if 
  running services needed to be restarted after the update process ('checkrestart' is called on the remote machine)
    |_ these services are marked yellow in the "Logs" view
