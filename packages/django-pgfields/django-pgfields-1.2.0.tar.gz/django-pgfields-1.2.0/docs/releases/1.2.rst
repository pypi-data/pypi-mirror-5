===================
django-pgfields 1.2
===================

Welcome to django-pgfields 1.2!

Overview
--------

This release builds on django-pgfields 1.1 by adding support for coercing
UUID fields to classes other than uuid.UUID.

Features
--------

* UUIDField now supports a ``coerce_to`` argument, defaulting to
  ``uuid.UUID``. The obvious use case for setting this is if you need
  to get back str objects instead.
