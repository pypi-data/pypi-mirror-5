# Glint
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mlowen/Glint.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mlowen/Glint)

Glint is a micro framework for command line applications, it creates the needed parameters that should be passed to the application based on the function signatures that it is supplied.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for Glint came from wanting to have a command driven cli app similar to how git works which I was unable to replicate with [argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html).

## Requirements

Glint requires Python 3.3 or higher to run, it has no other dependencies outside of the python core library.

## Installation

To install Glint once you have a copy run from the projects root directory:

```
python ./setup.py install
```

## Usage

All usage documentation for Glint can be found over at [read the docs](https://glint.readthedocs.org/). 

## Future Plans

If you want to see what's coming up in the near future for Glint go visit the [huboard](http://huboard.com/mlowen/Glint/board) for the project.

## Contributing

The source for Glint can be found over at [Github](https://github.com/mlowen/Glint), if you want to contribute that would be a good place to start. If you are wanting to report a bug all of that is kept at github as well in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mlowen/Glint/issues), the issues are also used to track upcoming work on Glint though features/issues that will be worked on before the next release can be more easily visualised over at [huboard](http://huboard.com/mlowen/Glint/board).  If you want to keep a track of the status of the bleeding edge then you'll able to see the current state at [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/mlowen/Glint).

### Submitting changes

You've downloaded/cloned Glint and made some changes you'd like to have merged in, firstly awesome thanks hugely! There are a couple of guidelines around submitting changes:

* Changes will only be accepted via pull requests on github.
* Any code changes should have some unit tests, if it's a fix for a bug it won't be accepted unless it has tests.
* Again with any code changes if your pull request [breaks the build](https://travis-ci.org/mlowen/Glint/pull_requests) it won't be accepted.

### Running the tests

While Glint doesn't have any dependencies outside of the python core library you will need to install [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to run the tests. Once that is installed you have two options for running the test you can run either:

```
nostests
``` 
or
```
python ./setup.py test
```
