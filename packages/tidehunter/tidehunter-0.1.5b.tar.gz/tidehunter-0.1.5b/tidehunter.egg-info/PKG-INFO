        Highlights
        ----------
        
        - Stream data queue, state machine, and record counter based on Redis and redis-py.
        - Based on the solid cURL and PycURL.
        - OAuth support based on python-oauth2.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install tidehunter
        
        Or to update:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install tidehunter --upgrade
        
        Note: the package will install all Python dependencies for you. However you need to have Redis installed and running.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See demo_.
        
        .. _demo: https://github.com/amoa/tidehunter/tree/master/demo
        
        Test (Unit Tests)
        -----------------
        
        The tests are done through Travis-CI already.
        
        However, running the full test within your local environment is just three lines, provided that you have Redis installed and running:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
            $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=tidehunter

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.1.5b (2013-07-22)
        -------------------
        
        - NEW: :code:`Hunter.tide_on()` now accepts an optional :code:`limit` parameter for on-the-fly limit adjustment. The adjustment is not permanent, meaning if you want to reuse the same :code:`Hunter` object, the old limit (or default None) is in effect. See :code:`demo/limit_on_the_fly.py` for sample usage.
        - [Major]: Fixed a potential issue of :code:`Hunter` puts in more records than desired limit.
        - [Minor]: Added temp Basic Auth test case (no stream, need to find a better source).
        
        0.1.3 (2013-07-13)
        ------------------
        
        - [Major]: use the great httpbin.org (by Kenneth Reitz) for unit test now.
        - [Major]: auth (oauth or basic) is no longer required, as long as the target stream server supports access without auth.
        
        0.1.2 (2013-07-12)
        ------------------
        
        - [Minor]: include CHANGES (changelog) to be shown on PyPi.
        - [Minor]: use with statement to open files for setup.py.
        - [Minor]: added the first `demo <https://github.com/amoa/tidehunter/tree/master/demo>`_.
        
        0.1.1 (2013-07-12)
        ------------------
        
        - [Minor]: clean up setup.py to ensure requirements are installed/updated.
        
        0.1.0 (2013-07-12)
