        Highlights
        ----------
        
        - Stream data queue, state machine, and record counter based on Redis and redis-py.
        - Based on the solid cURL and PycURL.
        - OAuth support based on python-oauth2.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install tidehunter
        
        Or to update:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install tidehunter --upgrade
        
        Note: the package will install all Python dependencies for you. However you need to have Redis installed and running.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See demo_.

        Test (Unit Tests)
        -----------------
        
        The tests are done through Travis-CI already.
        
        However, running the full test within your local environment is just three lines, provided that you have Redis installed and running:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
            $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=tidehunter
