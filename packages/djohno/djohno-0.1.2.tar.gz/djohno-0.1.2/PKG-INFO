        djohno is a tiny app for checking over your error pages, and email
        integration - to stop me doing evil things post-production to ensure
        I've set up Sentry and my error pages by randomly breaking parts of my
        site by editing code live.

          `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` to a friendly address (`Your Name
          <you@yourcompany.com>`);
