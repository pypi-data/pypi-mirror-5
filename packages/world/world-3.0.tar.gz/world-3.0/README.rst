world -- Print mappings between country names and DNS country codes.
====================================================================

This script takes a list of Internet top-level domain names and prints out
where in the world those domains originate from.  For example:

    $ world tz us
    tz originates from TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF
    us originates from UNITED STATES

Reverse look ups are also supported.

    $ world -r united
    Matches for "united":
      ae: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
      gb: UNITED KINGDOM
      tz: TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF
      uk: United Kingdom (common practice)
      um: UNITED STATES MINOR OUTLYING ISLANDS
      us: UNITED STATES

Only two-letter country codes are supported, since these are the only ones
freely available from the ISO_ 3166_ standard.

This script also knows about non-geographic, generic, USA-centric, historical,
common usage, and reserved top-level domains.
