2.2 (2013-10-07)
----------------

* Add ``fg`` command line option to start the script on the
  foreground.  For best results, combine this with enabling the
  ``supervised_daemon`` option. Patch provided by Maurits van Rees
  from Zest Software.


2.1 (2013-08-19)
----------------

* Update recipe to include the deamon script itself and update it to
  work with Python 2.6 and 2.7. This script used to require Python
  2.4.

* Update the start/stop script to be more reliable with the help of
  `psutil`_.

.. _psutil: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil


2.0 (2012-08-23)
----------------

* Update recipe to work with the egg distribution of MaildropHost,
  still creating the configuration and start/stop script for the
  daemon in buildout.

1.2 (2009-02-13)
----------------

* Fix ``download-cache`` vs ``download-directory``. Don't assume the
  user already set it.

* Add options ``wait_interval``, ``add_messageid``, ``batch``,
  ``tls``, ``pid_file``, ``spool_dir``, ``mail_dir``.

* Remove the relative to buildout directory option ``mail-dir`` which
  was almost useless.

* Improve the control script.

1.1 (2009-01-23)
----------------

* Added support for MaildropHost >= 1.22 (added a version option, so
  the recipe can guess the config file name)

1.0.1
-----

* Fix the config file for Windows paths.

1.0
---

* Define the ``location`` in options, so you could refer to the
  product folder with ``${maildrophost:location}`` for exemple.

* Add the ``target`` option to use a specific destination folder for
  the product.

* Add maildrophost options ``login``, ``password``, and
  ``poll_interval``.

0.1
---

* First release, download and install MaildropHost product, make a
  ``config.py`` and create simple script for start and stop purpose.
