Description: infrae.maildrophost
        ===================
        
        ``infrae.maildrophost`` is used to download and install `MaildropHost`_
        for Zope, and configure a maildrophost server using the same
        configuration than the Zope product.
        
        Example in buildout::
        
          [buildout]
          parts =
              maildrophost
              instance
        
          [maildrophost]
          recipe = infrae.maildrophost
          smtp_host = localhost
          smtp_port = 25
          version = 1.22
        
          [instance]
          ...
          products =
               ...
               ${maildrophost:location}
               ...
          ...
        
        This will install `MaildropHost`_, create configuration files for the
        daemon, and put a start/stop script in the ``bin`` directory of the
        buildout tree.
        
        Spool and PID files are put by default in the ``var/maildrop``
        directory, so data is preserved when update (if there is any data).
        
        You can use the ``target`` option to specify a different folder to
        install the product, for instance if you already have a part called
        ``dist-products`` for your Zope products::
        
          target = ${dist-products:location}
        
        The version option will be used to generate the download url::
        
          http://www.dataflake.org/software/maildrophost/maildrophost_<version>/MaildropHost-<version>.tgz
        
        In recent versions of `MaildropHost`_ (>= 1.22) the config file has
        changed name, setting the ``version`` option will make the recipe
        choose the right name.
        
        It is also possible to override the download url by setting a ``url``
        option.
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        You can customize some of settings of `MaildropHost`_:
        
        ``mail_dir``
          Directory to use as *home directory* for the deamon. By default it's
          ``${buildout:directory}/var/maildrop`` It will be created if it
          doesn't exists.
        
        ``spool_dir``
          Directory to use as a spool. By default it will be
          ``${mail_dir}/spool``. The directory will be created if it doesn't
          exist already.
        
        ``pid_file``
          PID file to use for the daemon. By default it will be
          ``${mail_dir}/maildrop.pid``.
        
        ``smtp_host``
          SMTP server to use. Default to localhost.
        
        ``smtp_port``
          Port to use. Default to default SMTP port, 25.
        
        ``login``
          If the SMTP server require authentication, login to use.
        
        ``password``
          If the SMTP server require authentication, password to use.
        
        ``tls``
          If 1, `MaildropHost`_ will be speaking to a TLS enabled SMTP server.
        
        ``batch``
          Set ``MAILDROP_BATCH``.
        
        ``add_messageid``
          Add a message id to the sent mail.
        
        ``pool_interval``
          Must be an integer which define the interval in seconds between two
          check for new mail in the spool directory. Default is 120 seconds.
        
        ``wait_interval``
          Must be an interger or float which say how much time the daemon
          should wait between sending two mails to the mail server.

        History
        =======
        
        1.2.1 (2013-09-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Add an option ``dont_create_directories`` to disable the creation of
          directories.
        
        1.2 (2009-02-13)
        ----------------
        
        * Fix ``download-cache`` vs ``download-directory``. Don't assume the
          user already set it.
        
        * Add options ``wait_interval``, ``add_messageid``, ``batch``,
          ``tls``, ``pid_file``, ``spool_dir``, ``mail_dir``.
        
        * Remove the relative to buildout directory option ``mail-dir`` which
          was almost useless.
        
        * Improve the control script.
        
        1.1 (2009-01-23)
        ----------------
        
        * Added support for MaildropHost >= 1.22 (added a version option, so
          the recipe can guess the config file name)
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        * Fix the config file for Windows paths.
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        * Define the ``location`` in options, so you could refer to the
          product folder with ``${maildrophost:location}`` for exemple.
        
        * Add the ``target`` option to use a specific destination folder for
          the product.
        
        * Add maildrophost options ``login``, ``password``, and
          ``poll_interval``.
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        * First release, download and install MaildropHost product, make a
          ``config.py`` and create simple script for start and stop purpose.
