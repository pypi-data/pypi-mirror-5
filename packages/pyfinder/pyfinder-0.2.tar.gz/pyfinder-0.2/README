Installing and using PyFinder
=============================

Introduction
============
The PyFinder library allows you to find files in the file-system and text
inside files. 
A script called ``pyfinder`` can be executed from the command line. For information
about the script usage, look at the output of ``pyfinder -h`` (once PyFinder is 
installed).


Supported Python versions
=========================
PyFinder requires Python version 3.3 or above.


Installation instructions
=========================
PyFinder is only released as a source distribution. Installing by 
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ is the simplest and preferred way on all systems::

    $ pip install pyfinder

Otherwise download the source tarball from `<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfinder>`_,
uncompress it, enter the pyfinder directory and then run the install command::

    $ python setup.py install
