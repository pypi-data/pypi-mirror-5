Description: SDIPy: Python Library for SDIP
        =========
        
        SDIPy is a python library for the Sensor Data Interoperability Protocol
        
        You often hear people say that we're 'overflowing with data' these days. On the other hand, it sometimes feels like we face a scarcity of the data we that really need most. We think there's still a great deal of room for more data in the world, particularly data of the right types. Importantly, all of the data floating around out there should be easily visualized, integrated and cross-correlated. The ability to generate powerful new data-streams should be accessible to anyone. This is particularly true for sensor data, which gives us access to the physical world and to our own bodily states, as they unfold continuously in time.

        1.0
        
        Installation
        --------------
        
        ```sh
        sudo pip install sdipy
        ```
        or (if you don't have pip installed)
        ```sh
        sudo easy_install install sdipy
        ```
        
        Use
        --------------
        Import the library: 
        ```py
        import sdipy
        ```
        Create a data object: 
        ```py
        data = sdipy.Data("Charles ECG",[{'time':0,'val':12343},{'time':1,'val':24434}])
        ```
        Create a packet: 
        ```py
        packet = sdipy.Packet(address = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF", timeFormat="millisec-rel", startTime={'format':'sec-epoch','time':1383842840},data=data)
        ```
        Read the [note on relative and abolute time] to understand how to time-stamp your data correctly.
        
        Now you have a SDIP-compatible packet, export to JSON for easy sending:
        ```py
        packet.exportJSON()
        ```
