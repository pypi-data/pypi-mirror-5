        A curses application for managing gunicorn processes. The ``ps`` command is 
        polled for gunicorn processes named with the ``setproctitle`` package and its 
        output is parsed to display a list of gunicorn processes showing the process 
        ID, port, name, rough memory used and number of workers for each gunicorn. 
        A gunicorn in the list can then be selected and several operations are 
        supported via keypresses such as modifying the number of worker process per 
        gunicorn as well as reloading or shutting down the master gunicorn process.
