        Description
        -----------
        
        Ximpia is an agile environment to speed up development of web projects.
        
        On the Front-end, you have visual components with properties defined in HTML5 templates. Server side data is mixed
        with components to render final HTML code. Most apps don't need to develop javascript, simply parametrize provided components 
        to define visual behavior.
        
        On the server side, you have a service-oriented architecture with views, actions, navigation flow and other server 
        services to help speed up development. Services produce JSON data that is processed by visual components.
