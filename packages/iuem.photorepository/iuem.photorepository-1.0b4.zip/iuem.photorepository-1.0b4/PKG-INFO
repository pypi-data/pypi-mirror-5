Description: Introduction
        ============
        Plone 4 products to manage Photos repository
        
        I'm new in plone development and this is my first product.
        So advise, corrections and suggestions are really welcome !
        
        This product is meant to satisfy a need at the institute where I work (IUEM,
        Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer, www-iuem.univ-brest.fr) and was
        initiated by the communication service.
        
        Special Thanks to :
        ===================
        Bertrand GOBERT : communication service in IUEM
        
        Jean-Michel FRANCOIS (aka toutpt) for his courses
        
        Tristan LE TOULLEC (plone integrator and developer in IUEM)
        
        Valentin Cadot (student who worked on this for 3 months)
        
        Features :
        ========== 
        
        The two main ideas of this product are :
        
        1- to add metadata for a finer grain research and selection
        
        2- to attribute/spread folder metadata to contained images and folders
        
        This product aims to dedicate your entire Plone site to a photos/images
        repository. Archetypes.schemaextender is largely used to extend metadata of
        folders and images. So _ALL_ folders and images are extended.
        
        When you add a new folder or image, you can use metadata already included in
        the vocabularies (like a thesaurus) or add new values which are added to the
        vocabularies when you save your new object.
        
        When an image is uploaded, the original image is copied to a new field and
        the Image field is modified : it is reduced and a watermark is applied.
        Only a user with permission 'iuem.photorepository: View Full Image',
        owner and manager by default, can access the original image.
        
        Because eea.facetednavigation is a very good tool to browse the database,
        I didn't develop a special search form.   
        
        collective.quickupload is recommended to upload groups of photos, but the module
        collective.zipfiletransport is also used.
        
        Installation :
        ==============
        
        Just add iuem.photorepository to egg list in your buildout.cfg
        
        
        TODO :
        ======

        - config view to manage some parameters : image transformation, permissions, etc...
