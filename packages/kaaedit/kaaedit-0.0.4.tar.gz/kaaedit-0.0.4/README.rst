Customization
==================

Kaa executes a Python script file at `~/.kaa/__kaa__.py` on startup. You can write Python script to customize Kaa as you like.

Sample - Show line numbers
----------------------------------

.. code:: python

   from kaa.filetype.default import defaultmode
   defaultmode.DefaultMode.SHOW_LINENO = True

`defaultmode.DefaultMode` is base class of all text file types. Line number is diplayed if `Defaultmode.SHOW_LINENO` is True. If you want to show line number of paticular file types, you can update SHOW_LINENO attribute of each file type classes.

.. code:: python

   # Show line number in HTML mode
   from kaa.filetype.html import htmlmode
   htmlmode.HTMLMode.SHOW_LINENO = True

Sample - Customize key binding
----------------------------------

Assign same keyboard shortcut of splitting windows command as Emacs.

.. code:: python

    from kaa.keyboard import *
    from kaa.filetype.default.defaultmode import DefaultMode
    
    DefaultMode.KEY_BINDS.append({
       ((ctrl, 'x'), '2'): 'editor.splithorz'    # Assign C-x 2 
    })
   
In this example, key sequence C-x 2 (control+x followed by 2) is assigned to 'editor.splithorz' command.
