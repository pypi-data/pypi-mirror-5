Cygwin environment on Windows platform is not supported at this time, but will be tested after they provide Python 3.3 package.

* Python 3.3 or later

* Headers and libraries for Python and ncurses with wide character support. Consult documentation of your platform for details. For Debian/Ubuntu, you can install ncurses library by ::

  $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev libncursesw5-dev 

* UTF-8 locales

Replace dialog
--------------

When `regex` button is checked, `Replace` string is also regular expression string. In this case, special characters like `\\t` or `\\n` are converted to tab character and newline character. Also, backreference character will be replaced to substring matched group in the search string. For example, when search string is `'(a+)(b+)'` and replace string is `\2\1`,  matched string `aabb` will be replaced to `bbaa`.


Grep dialog
------------

Grep dialog has three input field. `Search` is a plain text or regular expression string to search. `Directory` is a directory to start searching. If `Tree` button was checked, files are searched recursively. `Filenames` is space separeted list of file spec in shell-style wildcards (e.g., `*.txt *.py *.doc`). Up arrow key displays history of each input field.

In the grep result window, use F9 and F10 key to traverse matches forward/backward. 

Customization
==================

Kaa executes a Python script file at `~/.kaa/__kaa__.py` on startup. You can write Python script to customize kaa as you like.


Sample - Show line numbers
----------------------------------

.. code:: python

   from kaa.filetype.default import defaultmode
   defaultmode.DefaultMode.SHOW_LINENO = True

`defaultmode.DefaultMode` is base class of all text file types. Line number is diplayed if `Defaultmode.SHOW_LINENO` is True. If you want to show line number of paticular file types, you can update SHOW_LINENO attribute of each file type classes.

.. code:: python

   # Show line number in HTML mode
   from kaa.filetype.html import htmlmode
   htmlmode.HTMLMode.SHOW_LINENO = True

Sample - Customize key binding
----------------------------------

Assign same keyboard shortcut of splitting windows command as Emacs.

.. code:: python

    from kaa.keyboard import *
    from kaa.filetype.default.defaultmode import DefaultMode
    
    DefaultMode.KEY_BINDS.append({
       ((ctrl, 'x'), '2'): 'editor.splithorz'    # Assign C-x 2 
    })
   
In this example, key sequence C-x 2 (control+x followed by 2) is assigned to 'editor.splithorz' command.
