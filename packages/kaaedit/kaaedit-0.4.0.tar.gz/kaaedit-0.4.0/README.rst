Kaa is easy!
------------

Kaa is very easy to learn in spite of its rich functions. Only thing you need to remember is **"To display menu, hit F1 key or alt+'/' key"**. Most of basic feartures could be accessed from fancy menus by hitting underlined character in the menu items. You can use kaa as easy as you are with Notepad on MS-Windows.


Customizable
------------

Kaa is written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_. So, you can easily customize many aspects of kaa through simple Python scripts.


Supported environment
---------------------

Kaa is a CUI editor that runs on most of modern UN*X flavor operating systems like Linux or Mac OS X. Kaa requires Unicode friendly environment both platform running kaa and terminal emulator/console to interact with kaa.

Cygwin environment on Windows platform is not supported at this time, but will be tested after they provide Python 3.3 package.


Requirements
============

* Python 3.3 or later

* Headers and libraries for Python and ncurses with wide character support. Consult documentation of your platform for details. For Debian/Ubuntu, you can install ncurses library by ::

  $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev libncursesw5-dev 

* UTF-8 locales

* (optional) Cython


Installation
============

Use easy_install3 or pip3 to install kaa from PyPI ::

   $ easy_install3 kaaedit


Command line options
====================

To start kaa, type ::

   $ kaa [-h] [--version] [FILE [FILE ...]]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help  show this help message and exit
     --version show version info and exit
      
Terminal setting
================

For Mac OS X
-------------

Kaa uses alt key for keyboard shortcut like `alt+W` for copy to clipboard. On most of recent Windows or Linux terminal, alt key works just fine. But on Mac OS X, Terminal app should be configured:

1. Select Preferences menu.
2. Open the Settings tab.
3. Open the keyboard tab.
4. Check `Use option as meta key`.

Or, if you use iTerm on Mac, you should configure:

1. Select Preferences menu.
2. Open the Profiles tab.
3. Open the Keys tab.
4. Check `Left option Key acts as: +Esc.` button.

For Gnome Terminal(Ubuntu, etc.,)
----------------------------------

If you use Gnome terminal and wishes to access menu by F1 key, you should configure:

1. Select Edit | Keyboard shortcuts menu.
2. Scroll to the Help/Contents shortcut and change key from F1 to some another key.


Usage
=====

Using kaa is intuitive. Typing alphabet keys will update file as you expected. Functional keys like arrow or delete keys also works.


Using menu
-----------

To display menu, type F1 key or alt+/ (type slash key with alt key). Each items in the menu has one underlined character. The menu item is execused by typing the underlined key.

Replace dialog
--------------

When `regex` button is checked, `Replace` string is also regular expression string. In this case, special characters like `\\t` or `\\n` are converted to tab character and newline character. Also, backreference character will be replaced to substring matched group in the search string. For example, when search string is `'(a+)(b+)'` and replace string is `\2\1`,  matched string `aabb` will be replaced to `bbaa`.


Grep dialog
------------

Grep dialog has three input field. `Search` is a plain text or regular expression string to search. `Directory` is a directory to start searching. If `Tree` button was checked, files are searched recursively. `Filenames` is space separeted list of file spec in shell-style wildcards (e.g., `*.txt *.py *.doc`). Up arrow key displays history of each input field.

In the grep result window, use F9 and F10 key to traverse matches forward/backward. 


Python console
--------------

Unlike Python's interactive console, Python console in kaa does not execute Python script until you hit alt+Enter key. Until then you can edit Python script as if you are with editors without worrying about newlines and indentations.

When alt+Enter key was hit, all text in the window is executed as Python script and the value of the expression is printed out to console window. If the script contains print expression, the text will also be printed out to console window. If a part of text in the console window is selected, only text in the selected region will be execused.


Customization
==================

Kaa executes a Python script file at `~/.kaa/__kaa__.py` on startup. You can write Python script to customize kaa as you like.


Sample - Show line numbers
----------------------------------

.. code:: python

   from kaa.filetype.default import defaultmode
   defaultmode.DefaultMode.SHOW_LINENO = True

`defaultmode.DefaultMode` is base class of all text file types. Line number is diplayed if `Defaultmode.SHOW_LINENO` is True. If you want to show line number of paticular file types, you can update SHOW_LINENO attribute of each file type classes.

.. code:: python

   # Show line number in HTML mode
   from kaa.filetype.html import htmlmode
   htmlmode.HTMLMode.SHOW_LINENO = True

Sample - Customize key binding
----------------------------------

Assign same keyboard shortcut of splitting windows command as Emacs.

.. code:: python

    from kaa.keyboard import *
    from kaa.filetype.default.defaultmode import DefaultMode
    
    DefaultMode.KEY_BINDS.append({
       ((ctrl, 'x'), '2'): 'editor.splithorz'    # Assign C-x 2 
    })
   
In this example, key sequence C-x 2 (control+x followed by 2) is assigned to 'editor.splithorz' command.
