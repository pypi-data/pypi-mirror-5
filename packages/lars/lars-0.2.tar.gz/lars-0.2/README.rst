lars
====

lars is a small Python framework for working with httpd logs (from a variety of
common servers like Apache, nginx, and IIS). The primary purpose is to provide
a set of conversions to ease loading such logs into relational databases, but
numerous other possiblities can be realized with a little imagination.

The project is written in `Python`_ and is open-sourced under the MIT license.
The `source code`_ can be obtained from GitHub. The `documentation`_ can be
read on ReadTheDocs.
