Description: ========
        pycronic
        ========
        
        This project is inspired by `cronic`_ and privided some useful functions
        like sending email error report by SMTP and store logs of crontab scripts.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use pip install from github: ::
        
            sudo pip install -e git+https://github.com/piglei/pycronic/#egg=pycronic
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        After the installation, run "cronic" in your command line to verify: ::
        
            $ cronic 
            Usage: cronic YOUR_COMMAND
        
            $ cronic ls
            Config file "/etc/pycronic.conf" does not exist!
            Run "cronic init" to create a default one."
        
        Now run "sudo cronic init" to creat a default config file under /etc, the default config
        file should looked like this: ::
        
            # Log path for pycronic, pycronic will store all logs to this directory
            log_path = /tmp/pycronic
        
            # Send an error email or not, default to not send
            send_alert_email = True
        
            # Email Title
            mail_title = [Cronic@%(host)s] Error occoured when running "%(command)s"
        
            # Email receivers
            # receivers = sample@sample.com
        
            # Email smtp server config
            [email_config_smtp]
            # username = username
            # host = smtp.sample.com
            # password = password
            # FROM = Cronic <pycronic@sample.com>
            # port = 587
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        cronic will output nothing if no error has occured when running a script: ::
        
            piglei@macbook-pro:etc$ cronic ls
            piglei@macbook-pro:etc$ cat /tmp/pycronic/ls.log 
            [The script result will be stored in the log file]
        
        But if an error has occured(cronic will check the standard error output), it will output
        an error message like this: ::
        
            $ cronic ls asdf
            Cronic Error Report
            ===================
        
            [2013-11-12 15:49:03.349575] Cronic detected failure or error output for the command:
        
            ls asdf
        
            RESULT CODE: 1
        
            ERROR OUTPUT: 
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
            ls: asdf: No such file or directory
        
            STANDARD OUTPUT:
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
            None
        
        If you have configured your crontab, now an email will send to your email address.
        
        You can also config "/etc/pycronic.conf" to send mail through smtp instead of using crontab 
        and this is the more recommended way.
        
        Rock crontab
        ============
        
        Now config your crontab, using pycronic to wrap your scripts: ::
        
        
            $ crontab -e
            # If you have not config your pycronic.conf's smtp config, you can still
            # use crontab to send error emails.
