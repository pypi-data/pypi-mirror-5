Pyhull
=======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shyuep/pyhull.png)](https://travis-ci.org/shyuep/pyhull)

Pyhull is a Python wrapper to qhull (http://www.qhull.org/) for the
computation of the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram.
It is written as a Python C extension, with both high-level and low-level
interfaces to qhull. It is currently based on the 2012.1 version of qhull.

Currently, there is no effective port of the qhull algorithm, especially for
higher dimensions. While isolated packages exist for up to 3D convex hulls,
no effective package exist for higher dimensions. The only other known code
which supports convex hulls in higher dimensions is the scipy.spatial package,
but that code is extremely inefficient compared to the original Qhull in C.
Pyhull is much faster than the scipy.spatial package.

Pyhull has been tested to scale to 10,000 7D points for convex hull
calculations (results in ~ 10 seconds), and 10,000 6D points for Delaunay
triangulations and Voronoi tesselations (~ 100 seconds). Higher number of
points and higher dimensions should be accessible depending on your machine,
but may take a significant amount of time.

Performance of pyhull
=====================

The table below indicates the time taken in seconds to generate the convex
hull for a given number of points in a specified number of dimensions. The
final col (Cmd-line qconvex) is the time taken to generate the data using a
subprocess call to command line qconvex as a comparison for pyhull.

</table>

It is clear from the above table that even in its early alpha form,
pyhull outperforms scipy.spatial for large number of points in higher
dimensions. Also, pyhull is tested to be safe in terms of usage with Python
multiprocessing, unlike a subprocess call to Qhull.

Usage
=====

It is generally recommended that you use the high-level wrapper functions and
classes in pyhull.

For useful analysis outputs, please use the high-level ConvexHull,
DelaunayTri and VoronoiTess classes in the convex_hull,
delaunay and voronoi modules respectively. For example,

    >>> from pyhull.convex_hull import ConvexHull
    >>> pts = [[-0.5, -0.5], [-0.5, 0.5], [0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [0,0]]
    >>> hull = ConvexHull(pts)
    >>> hull.vertices
    [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
    >>> hull.points
    [[-0.5, -0.5], [-0.5, 0.5], [0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [0, 0]]
    >>>
    >>> from pyhull.delaunay import DelaunayTri
    >>> tri = DelaunayTri(pts)
    >>> tri.vertices
    [[2, 4, 0], [4, 1, 0], [3, 4, 2], [4, 3, 1]]
    >>> tri.points
    [[-0.5, -0.5], [-0.5, 0.5], [0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [0, 0]]
    >>>
    >>> from pyhull.voronoi import VoronoiTess
    >>> v = VoronoiTess(pts)
    >>> v.vertices
    [[-10.101, -10.101], [0.0, -0.5], [-0.5, 0.0], [0.5, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5]]
    >>> v.regions
    [[2, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [3, 0, 1], [4, 0, 3], [4, 2, 1, 3]]

If you need more detailed output, consider using the lower-level
interface functions that are modelled after standard command line syntax of
various qhull programs:

    >>> from pyhull import qconvex, qdelaunay, qvoronoi
    >>>
    >>> pts = [[-0.5, -0.5], [-0.5, 0.5], [0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [0,0]]
    >>>
    >>> qconvex("i", pts)
    ['4', '0 2', '1 0', '2 3', '3 1']
    >>>
    >>> qdelaunay("i", pts)
    ['4', '2 4 0', '4 1 0', '3 4 2', '4 3 1']
    >>>
    >>> qvoronoi("o", pts)
    ['2', '5 5 1', '-10.101 -10.101', '0   -0.5', '-0.5      0', '0.5      0', '0    0.5', '3 2 0 1', '3 4 0 2', '3 3 0 1', '3 4 0 3', '4 4 2 1 3']

The return values are simply a list of strings from the output.
