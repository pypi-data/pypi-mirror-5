blohg is a simple and easy to use blog engine, that uses the Mercurial
SCM (or alternatively Git) as backend, to store the content of the posts
and pages.

blohg doesn't have a nice control panel nor WYSIWIG editors. All the
content is written using any text editor and reStructuredText with some
custom directives.
