Description: ARS: Autonomous Robot Simulator
        ===============================

        ARS is a physically-accurate open-source simulation suite for research and
        development of mobile manipulators and, in general, any multi-body system. It
        is modular, easy to learn and use, and can be a valuable tool in the process
        of robot design, in the development of control and reasoning algorithms, as
        well as in teaching and educational activities.
        
        It will encompass a wide range of tools spanning from kinematics and dynamics
        simulation to robot interfacing and control.
        
        The software is implemented in Python integrating the
        `Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/opende/>`_
        and the `Visualization Toolkit (VTK) <http://www.vtk.org/>`_.
        
        
        Installation and Requirements
        -----------------------------
        
        For installation instructions and requirements, see the
        `online documentation <http://ars-project.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/>`_.
        
        ARS relies in these software:
        
        * Python 2.7
        * ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) 0.12 (from rev 1864 could work but is untested) with Python bindings
        * VTK (Visualization Toolkit) 5.8 with Python bindings
        * NumPy 1.6
        
        Provided ODE and VTK are already installed, execute this to get ARS up and running:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install ARS
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The documentation is hosted at
        `ReadTheDocs.org <http://ars-project.readthedocs.org>`_
        and it is generated dynamically after each commit to the repository.

        Tests
        -----
        
        To run the included test suite you need more packages (``tox`` and ``mock``):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           ~/ars$ pip install -r requirements_test.txt
           ~/ars$ tox
