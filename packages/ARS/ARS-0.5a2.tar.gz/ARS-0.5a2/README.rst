ARS: Autonomous Robot Simulator
===============================


.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/ARS/badge.png
   :target: https://crate.io/packages/ARS/

ARS is a physically-accurate open-source simulation suite for research and
development of mobile manipulators and, in general, any multi-body system. It
is modular, easy to learn and use, and can be a valuable tool in the process
of robot design, in the development of control and reasoning algorithms, as
well as in teaching and educational activities.

It will encompass a wide range of tools spanning from kinematics and dynamics
simulation to robot interfacing and control.

The software is implemented in Python integrating the
`Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/opende/>`_
and the `Visualization Toolkit (VTK) <http://www.vtk.org/>`_.


Installation and Requirements
-----------------------------

For installation instructions and requirements, see the
`online documentation <http://ars-project.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/>`_.

ARS relies in these software:

* Python 2.7
* ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) 0.12 (from rev 1864 could work but is untested) with Python bindings
* VTK (Visualization Toolkit) 5.8 with Python bindings
* NumPy 1.6

Provided ODE and VTK are already installed, execute this to get ARS up and running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install ARS


Documentation
