Using Pyg from the command line
===============================

Pyg should be used mostly from the command line, as it requires root's privileges to install and remove packages.

On some systems (e.g. on Unix systems), you may need root privileges to execute some commands such as :command:`install`, :command:`uninstall`, or :command:`upgrade`.
In this case you should use the :command:`sudo` command.

Main commands:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   cmdline/inst_uninst.rst
   cmdline/req_bund.rst
   cmdline/upgr_down_shell.rst

Minor commands:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   cmdline/minor_cmd.rst

Other stuff:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   config_files.rst
