Description: StructClass
        ===========
        
        This Python module allows to manipulate binary packed objects as classes.
        
        Similarly to the standard library struct module, objects can be packed or unpacked.
        
        Usage example
        -------------
        
            >>> from structclass import StructClass
            >>> SomePacket = StructClass('SomePacket', '<II', ['length', 'age'])
            >>> my_packet = SomePacket.unpack(b'12345678')[0]
            >>> my_packet
            SomePacket(length=875770417, age=943142453)
            >>> my_packet.age
            943142453
            >>> my_packet.pack()
            b'12345678'
