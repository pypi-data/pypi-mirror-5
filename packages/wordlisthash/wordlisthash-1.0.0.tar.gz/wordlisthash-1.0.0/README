wordlisthash.py

The wordlisthash.py is a module which serves as an utility for creating hashes of given words or a file of strings. The user can choose either run-time provided words or a file of passwords and get the output-hash-file.
Currently it supports only md5 hash function, and it is easy to add more hash functions to the module. More hash functions will be provided in the next version, and you are free to add or modify the code according to your need.
