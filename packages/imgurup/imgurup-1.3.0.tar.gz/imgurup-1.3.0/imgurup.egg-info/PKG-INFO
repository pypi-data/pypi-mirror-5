        Feature
        -------
        Support upload images(anonymously) or with your account.
        Support CLI, KDE, Zenity(GTK) and Mac dialog upload
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ::

        Usage
        -----
        ``img [-h] [-f <image path>] [-d [<album id>]] [-g] [-n]``
        
        You can just type ``img`` without any argument, the program will ask you for another infomation.
        
        But add ``-f`` argument with your image file would be easier to use, ex: ``img -f xx.jpg``
        
        After the authentication, the access_token and refresh_token will be saved in ``~/.imgurup.conf``
        
        Optional arguments:
        ::
        
        	-h, --help       show this help message and exit
        	-f <image path>  The image you want to upload
        	-d [<album id>]  The album id you want your image to be uploaded to
