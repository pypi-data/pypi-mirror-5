        Setting up kotti_blog
        =====================
        
        To activate the ``kotti_blog`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to
        add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste
        Deploy config.  ``kotti_blog`` depends on ``kotti_settings``, so you have to
        add also an entry for this add-on::
        
            kotti.configurators =
                kotti_settings.kotti_configure
                kotti_blog.kotti_configure
        
        ``kotti_blog`` adds two new Content Types to your Kotti site.
        Now you can create a blog and add blog entries to the blog.
        
        There are different settings to adjust the behavior of the blog. Point
        your browser to http://your.domain/@@settings to get to the settingspage
        or use the submenupoint of 'Site Setup'.
        
        You can select if the blog entries in the overview should
        be batched. If activated the blog entries will be shown
        on seperated pages. If not all blog entries are shown all together
        on one page.
        
        If you use batching you can choose how many blog entries are
        shown on one page.
        
        You can activate auto batching where the next page of the blog entries
        is automatically loaded when scrolling down the overview page instead
        of showing links to switch the pages.
        
        With the last setting you can control wether the headline of a blog entry
        in the overview is linked to the blog entry or not.
        
        Parts of kotti_blog can be overridden with the setting
        ``kotti_blog.asset_overrides``. Have a look to the
        `Kotti documentation about the asset_overrides setting`_, which is the same
        as in ``kotti_blog``.
