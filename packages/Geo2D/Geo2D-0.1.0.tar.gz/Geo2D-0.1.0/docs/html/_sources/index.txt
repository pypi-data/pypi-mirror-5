   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Geo2D's documentation!
=================================

This is the documentation for Geo2D `Python <http://python.org>`_ 3 compatible
package. I made this package because I started a pet-project, a little game that
I'm working on and I didn't find a suitable 2D geometry `Python
<http://python.org>`_ package. This and also because I wanted to learn a new few
things... practice makes perfect... well or at least fools you into thinking you
can become perfect.

So this is by no means a complete package, but it does the job I'm after at
least. Hope you'll find it as useful as I did.
