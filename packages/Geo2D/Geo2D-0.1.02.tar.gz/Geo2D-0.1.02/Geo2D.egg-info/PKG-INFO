Description: =====
        Geo2D
        =====
        
        This package has come to life from the need of a (pure) `Python`_ geometry
        package (`Python`_ 3 compatbile) for my pet project(s). I didn't find a
        satisfactory `Python`_ package/module for my needs so... here comes Goe2D (which
        is by no means state of the art... it just does what I hope it would do and it
        doesn't have any dependencies except for the standard `Python`_ library).
        Stating that, it includes only these classes:
        
        * Point
        * Vector
        * Line
        * Ray
        * Segment
        * Polygon
        
        Example::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from geo2d import geometry as g
        
            p1 = g.Point((0, 1))
            p2 = g.Point((4.2, 5))
            print(p1.distance_to(p2))
            l = g.Segment(p1, p2)
        
        And so on. More details about the technical stuff is in the docs/html.
