To build the four plugins that make up the application:


  On Linux:

 1) Make sure you have Trac installed and available in the Python lookup 
    path. Genshi should also be available in the Python lookup path.
    To make these libraries available to Python you can either install them
    centrally, or reference them using the PYTHONLIB environment variable.
 2) Unzip the source code distribution package
 3) Open a shell, cd into the root directory coming from the source code 
    distribution package
 4) Build the source code using the provided buil.sh script:
 
    . ./build.sh
 
    The build shell script can copy the resulting egg files into your desired 
    destination.
    If you wish to directly install the egg files under your Trac environment, 
    you can do that
    by providing your project root directory to the build.sh script:
    
    . ./build.sh path/to/your/project

 5) You will find the built egg files under the directory "bin".
    
    
  On Windows:

 1), 2), 3) Same as for Linux
 4) Build the source code using the provided buil.sh script:
 
    build.cmd
 
    The build shell script can copy the resulting egg files into your desired 
    destination.
    If you wish to directly install the egg files under your Trac environment, 
    you can do that by providing your project root directory to the build.sh 
    script:
    
    build.cmd path\to\your\project
    
 5) You will find the built egg files under the directory "bin".
    

==============================================================================
Use the following command to clean up the build:

  On Linux:

    . ./clean.sh

    
  On Windows:
    
    clean.cmd
