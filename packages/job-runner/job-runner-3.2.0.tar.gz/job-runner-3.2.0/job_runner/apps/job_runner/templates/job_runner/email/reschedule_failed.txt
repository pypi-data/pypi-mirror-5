The rescheduling for the following job failed!

Job title:
{{ job.title }}

Admin link:
http://{{ hostname }}{% url admin:job_runner_job_change job.pk %}


Probably this is because the server could not calculate a new schedule date
for this job because of the configured reschedule excludes.

A manual action is required to reschedule this job!
