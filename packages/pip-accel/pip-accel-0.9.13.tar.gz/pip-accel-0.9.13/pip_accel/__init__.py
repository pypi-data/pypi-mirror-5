# Accelerator for pip, the Python package manager.
#
# Author: Peter Odding <peter.odding@paylogic.eu>
# Last Change: August 7, 2013
# URL: https://github.com/paylogic/pip-accel
#
# TODO Permanently store logs in the pip-accel directory (think about log rotation).
# TODO Maybe we should save the output of `python setup.py bdist_dumb` somewhere as well?

"""
The Python module :py:mod:`pip_accel` defines the classes and functions that
implement the functionality of the pip accelerator and the ``pip-accel``
command. Instead of using the ``pip-accel`` command you can also use the pip
accelerator as a Python module. In this case you'll probably want to start by
taking a look at the following functions:

- :py:func:`unpack_source_dists`
- :py:func:`download_source_dists`
- :py:func:`build_missing_binary_dists`
- :py:func:`install_requirements`
