pip-accel: Accelerator for pip, the Python package manager
==========================================================

**Usage: pip-accel [ARGUMENTS TO PIP]**

The ``pip-accel`` program is a wrapper for `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_, the Python package manager. It accelerates the usage of ``pip`` to initialize `Python virtual environments <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_ given one or more `requirements <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#requirements-files>`_ files. It does so by combining the following two approaches:

1. Source distribution downloads are cached and used to generate a `local index of source distribution archives <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#fast-local-installs>`_. If all your dependencies are pinned to absolute versions whose source distribution downloads were previously cached, ``pip-accel`` won't need a network connection at all! This is one of the reasons why ``pip`` can be so slow: given absolute pinned dependencies available in the download cache it will still scan `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ and distribution websites.

2. `Binary distributions <http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/builtdist.html>`_ are used to speed up the process of installing dependencies with binary components (like `M2Crypto <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/M2Crypto>`_ and `LXML <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml>`_). Instead of recompiling these dependencies again for every virtual environment we compile them once and cache the result as a binary ``*.tar.gz`` distribution.

Usage
-----

The ``pip-accel`` command supports all subcommands and options supported by ``pip``, however it is of course only useful for the ``pip install`` subcommand. So for example::

   pip-accel install -r requirements.txt

If you pass a `-v` option then ``pip`` and ``pip-accel`` will both use verbose output. To enable verbose output from ``pip-accel`` only, you can set the environment variable ``PIP_ACCEL_VERBOSE``.

Based on the user running ``pip-accel`` the following file locations are used by default:

=============================  =========================  =======================================
Root user                      All other users            Purpose
=============================  =========================  =======================================
``/root/.pip/download-cache``  ``~/.pip/download-cache``  Assumed to be pip's download cache
``/var/cache/pip-accel``       ``~/.pip-accel``           Used to store the source/binary indexes
=============================  =========================  =======================================

These defaults can be overridden by defining the environment variables ``PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` and/or ``PIP_ACCEL_CACHE``.

How fast is it?
---------------

To give you an idea of how effective ``pip-accel`` is, below are the results of a test to build a virtual environment for one of the internal codebases of `Paylogic <http://www.paylogic.com/>`_. This code base requires more than 40 dependencies including several packages that need compilation with SWIG and a C compiler:

=========  ================================  ===========  ===============
Program    Description                       Duration     Percentage
=========  ================================  ===========  ===============
pip        Default configuration             444 seconds  100% (baseline)
pip        With download cache (first run)   416 seconds  94%
pip        With download cache (second run)  318 seconds  72%
pip-accel  First run                         397 seconds  89%
pip-accel  Second run                        30 seconds   7%

Control flow of pip-accel
-------------------------

The way ``pip-accel`` works is not very intuitive but it is very effective. Below is an overview of the control flow. Once you take a look at the code you'll notice that the steps below are all embedded in a loop that retries several times. This is mostly because of step 2 (downloading the source distributions).

1. Run ``pip install --no-index --no-install -r requirements.txt`` to unpack source distributions available in the local source index. This is the first step because ``pip-accel`` should accept ``requirements.txt`` files as input but it will manually install dependencies from cached binary distributions (without using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``):

  -  If the command succeeds it means all dependencies are already available as downloaded source distributions. We'll parse the verbose pip output of step 1 to find the direct and transitive dependencies (names and versions) defined in ``requirements.txt`` and use them as input for step 3. Go to step 3.

  -  If the command fails it probably means not all dependencies are available as local source distributions yet so we should download them. Go to step 2.

2. Run ``pip install --no-install -r requirements.txt`` to download missing source distributions to the download cache:

  -  If the command fails it means that pip encountered errors while scanning `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/>`_, scanning a distribution website, downloading a source distribution or unpacking a source distribution. Usually these kinds of errors are intermittent so retrying a few times is worth a shot. Go to step 2.

  -  If the command succeeds it means all dependencies are now available as local source distributions; we don't need the network anymore! Go to step 1.

3. Run ``python setup.py bdist_dumb --format=gztar`` for each dependency that doesn't have a cached binary distribution yet (taking version numbers into account). Go to step 4.

4. Install all dependencies from binary distributions based on the list of direct and transitive dependencies obtained in step 1. We have to do these installations manually because ``easy_install`` nor ``pip`` support binary ``*.tar.gz`` distributions.
