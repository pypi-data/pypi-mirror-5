Description: This is a wrapper executing a command and sending its stdout/stderr to the
        Sentry server.
        
        Useful to work with cron jobs. Unless misconfigured, the wrapper itself is
        quiet. It launches the program, captures its output, and if the program has
        been ended with non-zero exit code, builds a message and puts it to the remote
        server.
        
        .. warning:: Don't try to launch scripts producing a lot of data to
                     stdout / stderr with this wrapper, as it stores everything in
                     memory and thus can easily make your system swap.
        
        Example of cron task::
        
            SENTRY_DSN='http://...../'
            */30 * * * *  raven-sh -- bash -c 'echo hello world; exit 1'
