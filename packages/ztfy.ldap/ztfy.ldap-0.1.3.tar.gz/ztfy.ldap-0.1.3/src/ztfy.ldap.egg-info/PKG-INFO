        What is ztfy.ldap ?
        ===================
        
        ztfy.ldap is a small set of utilities and classes to make LDAP interaction
        easier within a ZTK/ZopeApp based application.
        
        The main class is LDAPGroupsFolder, which is an authentication plug-in used
        to enable LDAP groups as authentication principals. This class is extending
        ZTFY.security package so that LDAP groups can be used everywhere where a
        principal can be selected to grant a role.
        
        LDAPGroupsFolder code is mainly based on "ldapgroups" package, which seems
        actually unmaintained.
        
        Based on ldappool package, ztfy.ldap also provides a pooled LDAP adapter, which
        stores it's connections within a pool.
        
        Adapters for some of **ztfy.mail** interfaces are also provided.
