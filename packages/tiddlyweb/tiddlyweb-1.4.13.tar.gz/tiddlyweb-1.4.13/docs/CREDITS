1.0 to 1.2
----------

Once a stable 1.0 release of TiddlyWeb was out in the wild, the number
of people using the system, working the code and generally contributing
to its well being took off. The improvement of the code since then is
entirely the result of a diverse group of people from the TiddlyWeb
google group, the TiddlyWiki community and the people who operate in and
about Osmosoft.

The Osmosoft project to create TiddlySpace has helped make TiddlyWeb far
more robust, flexible and scalable.

I (Chris Dent) am especially grateful to FND for his continued
enthusiasm, limitless contributions, dogged attention to detail and
invaluable service as a rubber duck.

Thanks to BT for continuing to believe that supporting open source
development has benefits in the short and long term. Without BT's
support there would likely be no TiddlyWeb.

Birth to 1.0
------------

The architecture, attitude and action of TiddlyWeb is the result of
ideas and interactions with many people, all of whom are impossible to
list here, but a few highlights:

* The original mo'ass (mother of all server sides) idea, including the
  concepts of recipes and bags, comes from Jeremy Ruston, the original
  inventor of TiddlyWiki.

* TiddlyWeb is a Python application in large part because of the WSGI
  specification, PEP 333, authored by Phillip J. Eby and the stalwart
  enthusiasm of Zac Bir, a long time Python confederate.

* Zac is also a conceptual parent of the architectural style that drives
  TiddlyWeb's extensibility in the stores and serializers and the
  challengers and extractors. All four are modeled, at a distance, on
  concepts in Zope and systems implemented or designed to varying
  degrees while at Socialtext.

* The RESTful principles, or at least web friendly principles depending
  on how strict you care to think about such things, that drive the
  TiddlyWeb HTTP API, are all based on research and development creating
  the Socialtext REST API with Matt Liggett and Matthew O'Connor.

* Frank McIngvale, the author of WikklyText which does the server-side
  wikitext to HTML transformation originally in TiddlyWeb and then extracted
  to a plugin (tiddlywebwiki), provided excellent input on many aspects
  of TiddlyWeb, and of course built the excellent WikklyText.

* Frederik Dohr is the earliest adopter of TiddlyWeb, and responsible
  for most of the code that creates the TiddlyWebWiki vertical. He's
  been invaluable in providing input on features, excellent bug reports,
  and general support and comradeship throughout the development process.

* Action requires communication to make go. Many thanks to Jon Lister,
  Martin Budden, Paul Downey, Phil Hawksworth, Phil Whitehouse, Simon
  McManus, Michael Mahemoff, Jon Robson and Ben Gillies from Osmosoft;
  Tony, Oveek, Reenen, Ben Tremblay and others from the TiddlyWikiDev
  and TiddlyWeb Google groups; and many others for comments, questions
  and conversations about TiddlyWeb.
