Description: 
            When you are worried about your site SEO, you probably make many things to correct problems such as creating
            redirects, correcting broken URLs etc. But, it can take a long time to Google come back and see that you've
            done a good job.
            
            Fortunately, you yourself can mark desired URLs as corrected. But, if you have a large number of indexed URLs
            and make lots of simultaneous changes, it can be hard to keep track of those URLs.
        
            google-seo-analyzer helps you by crawling all problematic URLs and generating a report about which statuses
            have been changed and by ordering URLs in such a way you can easily identify error patterns.
