Description: 
        win_unc
        =======
        
        A Python library for handling UNC paths on Windows.
        
        With this library you can
        
          * Connect UNC directories to your Windows session
          * Connect UNC directories requiring authorization
            by providing credentials
          * Mount UNC directories (with or without credentials)
            to a local mount point
          * Disconnect/unmount UNC connections
          * Query existing UNC connections known by the
            Windows session

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install::
        
            $ pip install win_unc
        
        
        Sneak Preview
        =============
        
        Below is a simple example::
        
            from win_unc import UncDirectoryMount, UncDirectory, DiskDrive
        
            conn = UncDirectoryMount(UncDirectory(r'\home\shared'), DiskDrive('Z:'))
            conn.mount()
            print 'Drive connected:', conn.is_mounted()
            conn.unmount()
        
        You can also provide credentials like this::
        
            from win_unc import UncCredentials
        
            unc = UncDirectory(r'\home\shared', UncCredentials('user', 'pwd'))
            conn = UncDirectoryMount(unc, DiskDrive('Z:'))
        
        Or just connect the path without mounting it::
        
            from win_unc import UncDirectoryConnection
        
            conn = UncDirectoryConnection(r'\home\shared')
            conn.connect()
