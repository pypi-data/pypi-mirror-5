<p>Structured text is text that uses indentation and simple
symbology to indicate the structure of a document. <br />
A structured string consists of a sequence of paragraphs separated by
one or more blank lines.  Each paragraph has a level which is defined
as the minimum indentation of the paragraph.  A paragraph is a
sub-paragraph of another paragraph if the other paragraph is the last
preceding paragraph that has a lower level.</p>
<p>Special symbology is used to indicate special constructs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A single-line paragraph whose immediately succeeding paragraphs are lower
  level is treated as a header.</p></li>
<li><p>A paragraph that begins with a '-', <code>*</code>, or <code>o</code> is treated as an
  unordered list (bullet) element.</p></li>
<li><p>A paragraph that begins with a sequence of digits followed by a
  white-space character is treated as an ordered list element.</p></li>
<li><p>A paragraph that begins with a sequence of sequences, where each
  sequence is a sequence of digits or a sequence of letters followed
  by a period, is treated as an ordered list element.</p></li>
<li><p>A paragraph with a first line that contains some text, followed by
  some white-space and <code>--</code> is treated as
  a descriptive list element. The leading text is treated as the
  element title.</p></li>
<li><p>Sub-paragraphs of a paragraph that ends in the word <code>example</code> or the
  word <code>examples</code>, or <code>::</code> is treated as example code and is output as is:
<pre>
    &lt;table border=0&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; Foo 
    &lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
</p></li>
<li><p>Text enclosed single quotes (with white-space to the left of the
  first quote and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second quote)
  is treated as example code.<p>  For example: <code>&amp;lt;dtml-var foo&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Text surrounded by '<em><code> characters (with white-space to the left of the
  first </code></em><code> and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second </code><em>')
  is </em>emphasized*.</p></li>
<li><p>Text surrounded by '<strong><code> characters (with white-space to the left of the
  first </code></strong><code> and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second </code><strong>')
  is made </strong>strong**.</p></li>
<li><p>Text surrounded by <code>_</code> underscore characters (with whitespace to the left 
  and whitespace or punctuation to the right) is made _underlined_.</p></li>
<li><p>Text encloded by double quotes followed by a colon, a URL, and concluded
  by punctuation plus white space, <em>or</em> just white space, is treated as a
  hyper link.<p>  For example, <code>&amp;quot;Zope&amp;quot;:http://www.zope.org/</code> is interpreted as 
  <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> </p>
<p>  <em>Note: This works for relative as well as absolute URLs.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Text enclosed by double quotes followed by a comma, one or more spaces,
  an absolute URL and concluded by punctuation plus white space, or just
  white space, is treated as a hyper link.<p>  For example: <code>&amp;quot;mail me&amp;quot;, mailto:amos@digicool.com</code> is 
  interpreted as <a href="mailto:amos@digicool.com">mail me</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p>Text enclosed in brackets which consists only of letters, digits,
  underscores and dashes is treated as hyper links within the document.<p>  For example: <code>"As demonstrated by Smith &amp;#091;12&amp;#093; this technique ..."</code> </p>
<p>  Is interpreted as: "As demonstrated by Smith <a href="#12"><a href="#12">[12]</a></a> this technique"</p>
<p>  Together with the next rule this allows easy coding of references or end notes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Text enclosed in brackets which is preceded by the start of a line, two
  periods and a space is treated as a named link. For example:<p>  <code>.. &amp;#091;12&amp;#093; "Effective Techniques" Smith, Joe ...</code></p>
<p>  Is interpreted as </p>
<p>  <a name="12"><a href="#12">[12]</a></a> "Effective Techniques" Smith, Joe ...</p>
<p>  <em>Note:  see the &lt;A NAME="12"&gt; in the HTML source.</em></p>
<p>  Together with the previous rule this allows easy coding of references or
  end notes.</p>
