Rich text editing is when you enter text with formatting
as part of what you are writing. You can yourself select which words should be bold
or italic for example.</p>


<p>If you select the WYSIWYG display format a JavaScript driven widget will appear where 
there used to be larger input boxes such as where you enter the description when you 
submit a new issue. This JavaScript widget will load dynamically into your webbrowser
and will therefore appear a bit slow the first time you load it on a computer you have
not used it on before. Once loaded all the dynamic JavaScript files will locally 
cached on your computer for subsequent use.</p>


<p>The WYSIWYG editor that the IssueTrackerProduct uses is 
<a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a> developed under LGPL by
<a href="http://www.moxiecode.com/">Moxiecode Systems AB</a>.
This JavaScript widget is only supported with certain browsers (most common and modern ones).
If you are experiencing problems, check that your browser is OK on this
