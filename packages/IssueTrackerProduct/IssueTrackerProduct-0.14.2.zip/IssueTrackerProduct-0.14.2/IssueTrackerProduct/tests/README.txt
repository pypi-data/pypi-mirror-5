export DEBUG_ISSUETRACKERPRODUCT=1

You might want to disable CheckoutableTemplates:
export DISABLE_CHECKOUTABLE_TEMPLATES=1

To run all IssueTracker tests
./bin/zopectl test --dir Products/IssueTrackerProduct/tests/

To just run testIssueTracker.py
./bin/zopectl test --dir Products/IssueTrackerProduct/tests/ --tests-pattern=testIssueTracker

To just run testIssueTracker.py but only test called test_debatingIssue()
./bin/zopectl test --dir Products/IssueTrackerProduct/tests/ --tests-pattern=testIssueTracker --test=test_debatingIssue


Include --keepbytecode when the set of tests gets large. At the time of

If you're testing this in Zope 2.8 you'll have to use this syntax
instead:

./bin/zopectl test --dir Products/IssueTrackerProduct/tests testEmailIn
