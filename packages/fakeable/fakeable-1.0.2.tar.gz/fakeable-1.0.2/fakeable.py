class Fakeable(type):
    """
    A metaclass to be used by types that wish to be fakeable.

    In order to make a class fakeable,
    all that needs to be done is set *fakeable.Fakeable* as its metaclass.
    In Python 2, this done by setting the special attribute
    ``__metaclass__ = fakeable.Fakeable`` in the class definition.
    In Python 3, this is done by specifying ``metaclass=fakeable.Fakeable``
    in the base class list of the class definition.

    Python 2 example::

        class HttpDownloader(object):
            __metaclass__ = fakeable.Fakeable
            ...

    Python 3 example::

        class HttpDownloader(metaclass=fakeable.Fakeable):
            ...

    If you have the third-party ``six`` module installed,
    then you can do this in a way that works in both Python 2 and Python 3::

        class HttpDownloader(six.with_metaclass(fakeable.Fakeable)):
            ...

    The name used in the *fakeable* module functions to refer to this class
    is simply the name of the class.
    This value is stored in the ``__FAKE_NAME__`` attribute of the class.
    If a class explicitly defines a ``__FAKE_NAME__`` attribute
    then that value will be used instead of the default.

class FakeableCleanupMixin(object):
    """
    A convenience class that can be inherited by unit test classes so that
    fakes are automatically cleaned up before and after each test runs.
    This helps prevent fake objects inadvertently leaking into other test cases,
    which can cause difficult-to-diagnose behaviour when it happens.

    This class is intended to be subclassed by other classes that also inherit
    from ``unittest.TestCase``.
    It defines :meth:`~fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin.setUp` and
    :meth:`~fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin.tearDown`, both of which simply invoke
    :func:`fakeable.clear` and the method of the same name in the superclass.

    *Example*: using this "mixin" class in a ``unittest.TestCase``::

        class TestSomething(fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin, unittest.TestCase):
            def test(self):
                fakeable.set_fake_class("Something", FakeSomething)
                self.assertTrue(do_something())

    Before the method ``test()`` is executed the ``setUp()`` method will invoke
    :func:`fakeable.clear` to make sure there are no leftover fakes that were
    registered elsewhere.  Also, after the ``test()`` method completes,
    ``tearDown()`` will invoke  :func:`fakeable.clear` to make sure that none of
    the registered fakes are left behind to screw things up downstream.

    Note, however, that ``fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin``
    *must* occur before ``unittest.TestCase`` in the base class list.
    Otherwise, the ``setUp()`` and ``tearDown()`` methods of
    ``FakeableCleanupMixin`` will not be invoked.

    *Bad Example (of specifying base classes of a test case)*::

        # BAD!! -- because unittest.TestCase is specified *before*
        # fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin in the base class list,
        # the setUp() and tearDown() methods of FakeableCleanupMixin will not
        # be invoked, defeating the purpose of adding it as a base class
        class TestSomething(unittest.TestCase, fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin):
            ...

    *Good Example (of specifying base classes of a test case)*::

        # GOOD -- because unittest.TestCase is specified *after*
        # fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin in the base class list,
        # the setUp() and tearDown() methods of FakeableCleanupMixin *will*
        # be invoked, properly unregistering all registered fakes
        class TestSomething(fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin, unittest.TestCase):
            ...

    If the ``FakeableCleanupMixin`` subclass also wants to override ``setUp()``
    and/or ``tearDown()``, be sure to use the ``super()`` built-in to call the
    method of the same name in the superclass (as opposed to naming the
    superclass and calling it directly).  Using ``super()`` ensures that the
    method-resolution order ("mro") will be used and each superclass' method
    will be invoked in the correct order.

    *Bad Example (of overriding the setUp() method)*::

        class TestSomething(fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin, unittest.TestCase):
            def setUp(self):
                # BAD!! -- does not respect the MRO and some superclass setUp()
                # methods may not be invoked
                fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin.setUp(self)
                ...

    *Good Example (of overriding the setUp() method)*::

        class TestSomething(fakeable.FakeableCleanupMixin, unittest.TestCase):
            def setUp(self):
                # GOOD -- respects the MRO and ensures that the setUp() method
                # of each superclass is invoked and in the correct order
                super(TestSomething, self).setUp()
                ...
    """

    def setUp(self):
        """
