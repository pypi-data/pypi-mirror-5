class Fakeable(type):
    """
    A metaclass to be used by types that wish to be fakeable.

    In order to make a class fakeable,
    all that needs to be done is set *fakeable.Fakeable* as its metaclass.
    In Python 2, this done by setting the special attribute
    ``__metaclass__ = fakeable.Fakeable`` in the class definition.
    In Python 3, this is done by specifying ``metaclass=fakeable.Fakeable``
    in the base class list of the class definition.

    Python 2 example::

        class HttpDownloader(object):
            __metaclass__ = fakeable.Fakeable
            ...

    Python 3 example::

        class HttpDownloader(metaclass=fakeable.Fakeable):
            ...

    If you have the third-party ``six`` module installed,
    then you can do this in a way that works in both Python 2 and Python 3::

        class HttpDownloader(six.with_metaclass(fakeable.Fakeable)):
            ...

    The name used in the *fakeable* module functions to refer to this class
    is simply the name of the class.
    This value is stored in the ``__FAKE_NAME__`` attribute of the class.
    If a class explicitly defines a ``__FAKE_NAME__`` attribute
    then that value will be used instead of the default.
