Fakeable - Transparently Use Fake Objects in Unit Tests
=======================================================

.. moduleauthor:: Denver Coneybeare

*Fakeable* is a Python library that allows seamlessly replacing "real" objects
with "fake" objects during unit testing.
"Faking out" objects is a generally-accepted practice in unit testing
to make it easy to traverse every code path of a method or function
without having to set up a real environment to make that happen.
*Fakeable* works at the *class* level
and any class that wants to be fakeable during unit tests
need only add a single line to its class definition to make this dream a reality.

*Fakeable* is supported in Python 2.7 and Python 3.3,
and also has been confirmed to work in PyPy 2.1 and PyPy3 2.1-beta1.

*Fakeable* is free and open-source software,
released under the Apache License Version 2.0.
