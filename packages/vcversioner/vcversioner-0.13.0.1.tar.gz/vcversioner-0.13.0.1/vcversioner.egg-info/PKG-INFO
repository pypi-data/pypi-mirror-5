        In-depth documentation: https://vcversioner.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        `Elevator pitch`_: you can write a ``setup.py`` with no version number
        specified, and vcversioner will find a recent properly-formatted git tag and
        extract the version number from it.
        
        To quote myself:
        
            It's much more convenient to be able to use your version control system's
            tagging mechanism to derive a version number than to have to duplicate that
            information all over the place.
        
        I ended up copy-pasting the same code into a couple different ``setup.py``
        files just to avoid duplicating version information. But, copy-pasting is dumb
        and unit testing ``setup.py`` files is hard. Thus: vcversioner.
        
        Basic use
        =========
        
        vcversioner installs itself as a distutils hook, which makes its use
        exceedingly simple::
        
          from setuptools import setup
        
          setup(
              # [...]
              setup_requires=['vcversioner'],
              vcversioner={},
          )
        
        The presence of a ``vcversioner`` argument automagically activates vcversioner
        and updates the project's version. In most cases, the following line should
        also be added to ``MANIFEST.in``::
        
          include version.txt
