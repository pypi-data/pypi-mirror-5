Description: 
        Piratebay-BUA, 
        ==============
        
        -------------------------------
        Stand for ( Better User Agent )
        -------------------------------
        
        	Piratebay is a thepiratebay dot org screenscraper, with it one can easily search for torrents.
        	Order by any column, such as user / seeders / leechers. It is in early stages right now, but more
        	features are being implemented by the day.
          
        	It Also include a better User-Agent randomize algorithm for entropy testing purposes. And ultimately
        	some major redirection of the content to be an appropriate package for Security and Legislation to 
        	dig inside a content to chunk the information within merely illegal like pure-copy, personal enhancement
        	in software redistribution, and totally illegal like malware and method-prone to collect citizen data
        	for financial purposes.
          
        
        Missing features
        ================
        
        	- Acces to Meta-data, get environment Information.
        	- Downloading a Torrent will be available but restrictive reason will
        	be asked for monitoring purposes. 
        		- ( and delivered to authority for evaluation purposes, or get the real piratebay, it's analysis tools here ) .
        		- parse the torrent info page.
        		- parse the comments.
        		- the descriptions.
        		- simulating the answer over wide range of browser.
        		- Extracting information in quest of developping baysian rejection filter and 
        		auto-analysis or even increasing amount of category, leaving real legality in
        		pirate boxes...
        	- Object Analysis tools with pylibelf and PE under Windows Compatible.
        	- documentation will be clearer .
        	
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        	By using distutils(setup.py), so you can easily install this on most system with no trouble.
        	From the base dir:
        	python setup.py install (you would need root access depending on the system being used(`sudo'))
          
        	You can download the latest versions released from <<No pypi for the moment, crude develpt and 
        	in correct stuff will cause problem and rejection, but maxistedeams will release it >>
        	or download the development version straight from the mercurial repository hosted by me at:
        	git://github.com/priendeau/PirateBay-BUA.git.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        	
        	Is currently lacking, about every method is documented in the source. But future prototype will
        	become move and more verbosis and Final realse will include test-case and a lot of documentation.
