Piratebay-BUA, 
==============

-------------------------------
Stand for ( Better User Agent )
-------------------------------

	Piratebay is a thepiratebay dot org screenscraper, with it one can easily search for torrents.
	Order by any column, such as user / seeders / leechers. It is in early stages right now, but more
	features are being implemented by the day.
  
	It Also include a better User-Agent randomize algorithm for entropy testing purposes. And ultimately
	some major redirection of the content to be an appropriate package for Security and Legislation to 
	dig inside a content to chunk the information within merely illegal like pure-copy, personal enhancement
	in software redistribution, and totally illegal like malware and method-prone to collect citizen data
	for financial purposes.
  

Missing features
================

	- Acces to Meta-data, get environment Information.
	- Downloading a Torrent will be available but restrictive reason will
	be asked for monitoring purposes. 
		- ( and delivered to authority for evaluation purposes, or get the real piratebay, it's analysis tools here ) .
		- parse the torrent info page.
		- parse the comments.
		- the descriptions.
		- simulating the answer over wide range of browser.
		- Extracting information in quest of developping baysian rejection filter and 
		auto-analysis or even increasing amount of category, leaving real legality in
		pirate boxes...
	- Object Analysis tools with pylibelf and PE under Windows Compatible.
	- documentation will be clearer .
	

Installing
==========

	By using distutils(setup.py), so you can easily install this on most system with no trouble.
	From the base dir:
	python setup.py install (you would need root access depending on the system being used(`sudo'))
  
	You can download the latest versions released from <<No pypi for the moment, crude develpt and 
	in correct stuff will cause problem and rejection, but maxistedeams will release it >>
	or download the development version straight from the mercurial repository hosted by me at:
	git://github.com/priendeau/PirateBay-BUA.git.

Documentation
=============
	
	Is currently lacking, about every method is documented in the source. But future prototype will
	become move and more verbosis and Final realse will include test-case and a lot of documentation.
