par2ools
-----------

A small set of "missing" tools for par2 archives:

* ``par2ls`` - list the files covered by a par2 archive
* ``par2mv`` - move the files (and par2 files) covered by a par2 archive
* ``par2unrar`` - verify, unpack, and optionally clean up par2 & files

These tools implement their own parsing of par2 header files, but in order to
use ``par2unrar`` you will need the ``par2`` command line utility and archive
utilities (like ``unrar``, ``unzip``, ``7zr``, etc).
