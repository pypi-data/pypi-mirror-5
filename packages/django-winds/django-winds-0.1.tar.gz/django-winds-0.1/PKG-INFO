Description: ============
        django-winds
        ============
        
        A tool to collect and serve wind prediction data. Designed to have pluggable backends for multiple wind-prediction services. So far UCAR_ is the only source and covers just the continental US.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use ``pip`` to install from PyPI::
        
        	pip install django-winds
        
        Add ``django_winds`` to your settings.py file::
        
        	INSTALLED_APPS = (
        	    ...
        	    'django_winds',
        	    ...
        	)
        
        Additional Requirements
        =======================
        
        ``beautifulsoup4`` to parse the XML served by THREDDS
        
        ``django-tastypie`` to generate the API
        
        Django Settings
        ===============
        
        ``DJANGO_WINDS_CACHE_TIMEOUT`` - Number of minutes to cache endpoint responses.
        
        ``DJANGO_WINDS_DEMO_MODE`` - True/False... not implemented yet.
        
        Acquiring Data
        ==============
        
        ``django-winds`` is really just a extract and transport layer for data. It exposes an API that takes a Point (latitude/longitude) and returns wind predictions for that location.
