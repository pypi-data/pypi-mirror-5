        # Getting Started
        
        Import ViewSet to make a basic set of views for a particular model
        
            from viewsets import ViewSet
            
            pizza_viewset = ViewSet()
            
        Viewsets come with these basic views: list, create, detail, update, and delete
        
        You can then import those views into your urls file easy. The following code
        will install all of your viewsets at the default location.
        
            urlpatterns = ViewSet.all_urls()
        
        Import ViewSetMixin to use mixin with views that you are overriding
        
            from viewsets import ViewSet, ViewSetMixin
        
        
        Override default views or create your own with the viewset manager.
            
            @pizza_viewset.register("create")
            class ToppingCreateView(ViewSetMixin, CreateView):
                        
                ....
