===================
 Auxiliary modules
===================

A number of small python modules are currently bundled with
*GromacsWrapper* as they have proven useful in the context of which
the main package is being used. However, *GromacsWrapper* does not
depend on them and they could be safely ignored (and might be removed
if we ever get to a 1.0 release...).
