==============================================
 :mod:`numkit` --- Numerical analysis toolkit
==============================================

A collection of functions and classes built on top of NumPy and SciPy
to aid the numerical analysis of data. It is geared towards the use of
data coming from molecular simulations, namely time series. It is used
in :mod:`gromacs.analysis` and :mod:`gromacs.fileformats`.

Please note that these functions are provided "as is" and no guarantee
is given that they are accurate or free from error. Bug reports and
test cases are very welcome. Please submit them through the Github
`Issue Tracker`_.
