SQLAlchemy-Fixtures
===================

SQLAlchemy-Fixtures is a python package that provides functional fixtures for
SQLAlchemy based models.

QuickStart
----------

At the heart of SQLAlchemy-Fixtures there are two functions: fixture and last_fixture.
Function fixture is used for constructing fixtures from models and last_fixture is used
for getting the last created fixture for given model.

Consider the following model definition:

::

    import sqlalchemy as sa
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
    Base = declarative_base(engine)
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    class User(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'user'

        id = sa.Column(sa.BigInteger, autoincrement=True, primary_key=True)
        name = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(100))
        email = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(255))


Most of the time you will want your models to contain some default values. This can be
achieved by using FixtureRegistry.set_defaults function
::

    from sqlalchemy_fixture import FixtureRegistry, fixture, last_fixture

    FixtureRegistry.set_defaults(User, {'name': 'someone'})

    user = fixture(User)
    user.name  # someone

    last_fixture(User) == user


Sometimes you may want to create fixtures without adding them into session and committing the session.
SQLAlchemy-Fixtures provides a function called new for this: ::


    from sqlalchemy_fixture import new

    # the following object is not saved into database
    user = new(User, name=u'someone', email=u'john@example.com')


Lazy values
-----------

Lazy values provide a convenient way to generate values based on object attributes. In the following example
our User fixture will generate its email based on its name.
::

    from sqlalchemy_fixture import FixtureRegistry, Lazy, fixture, last_fixture

    FixtureRegistry.set_defaults(
        User, {'email': Lazy(lambda obj: '%s@example.com' % obj.name.lower())})

    user = fixture(User, name=u'someone')
    user.email  # someone@example.com
