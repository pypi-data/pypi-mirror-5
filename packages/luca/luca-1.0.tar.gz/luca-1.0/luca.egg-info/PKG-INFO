Description: The **luca** command lets you manage your finances
        using the same tools you use to manage the rest of your life:
        plain-text files, version control, and the command line.
        
        The name is pronounced *lew-cha* because it is Italian.
        The tool is named for Luca Pacioli,
        the Franciscan friar credited with the invention
        of double-entry bookkeeping.
