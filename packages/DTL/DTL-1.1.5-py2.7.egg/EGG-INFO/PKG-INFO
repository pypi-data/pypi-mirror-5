        Design
        ------
        The Dev Tools Library was designed to handle alot of bolier plate code, to free you up to design tools/scripts/applications without having to implement business logic and shared logic within the same tool/script/application.
        
        It provides useful utilities and class in a number of different areas from general(api) to user interface(gui) even to communication(networking)
