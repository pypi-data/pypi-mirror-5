         p4a.plonecalendar
        ===================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        p4a.plonecalendar provides nice calendaring views for Plone, specifically
        a Month, Week and Day view, and also nice lists of past and previous 
        events.
        
        There are today better calendaring views for Plone, specifcally solgema.fullcalendar.
        However, that's a JavaScript calendar, so if you need a calendar that you can use
        without JavaScript, for example for accessibility reasons, then p4a.plonecalendar
        is a good choice.
        
        Upgrading from version 2.0
        ==========================
        
        p4a.plonecalendar 2.1 removes the dependency on p4a.subtyper. As a result
        upgrading to p4a.plonecalendar can be a bit of work.
        
        Step 1:
        -------
        
        Firstly you need to add p4a.subtyper to your buildout.cfg.
        
        Under [instance] add "4a.subtyper" to the eggs property, remove
        p4a.plonecalendars zcml entries and replace them with p4a.subtypers zcml
        entries. The result should look something like this:
        
            [instance]
            ...
            
            eggs = 
                Plone
                p4a.plonecalendar
                p4a.subtyper
                ${buildout:eggs}
        
            zcml = 
                p4a.subtyper
                p4a.subtyper-meta
        
        Run buildout and restart the server.
        
        Step 2:
        -------
        
        Go to the ZMI and open the Upgrades tab of portal_setup: 
           http://yourplonesite/portal_setup/manage_upgrades
           
        Choose the p4a.plonecalendar:default profile, and the upgrade named
        "Upgrade to 2.1: Remove all marker interfaces" should be visible.
        Select it and press "Upgrade."
        
        Step 3:
        -------
        
        Then go to the quickinstaller: 
           http://yourplonesite/portal_quickinstaller/manage_installProductsForm
           
        Here, reinstall P4A Plone Calendar. You will after this have to go to all
        calendars and select a Calendar View as default view again.
        
        Step 4 (optional):
        ------------------
        
        If you have no other parts of Plone4Artists installed you can also uninstall
        Plone4Artists Subtyper, and remove it from the buildout.cfg.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. Add p4a.plonecalendar as a dependency either to your buildout:
              [buildout]
              eggs = p4a.plonecalendar
        
        2. Include p4a.plonecalendar ZCML:
              [instance]
              zcml = p4a.plonecalendar
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        Importing an iCalendar file via http
        ------------------------------------
        
        Plone4Artists calendar can import an iCalendar file over http into a Plone
        calendar. This is useful for example if another site presents a schedule
        that you also want to present or integrate into your site.
        
        An example url for importing an icalendar file over http is::
        
          http://path/to/calendar/import_from_url?url=http://url/to/icalendarfile.ics
        
        This will open up a connection to the other site, get the icalendar file
        called "icalendarfile.ics" and import it into the folder located at 
        /path/to/calendar/

        1.0rc1 (2007-07-31)
        -------------------
        
        - Many bug fixes resulting from the Boston 2007 P4A sprint
        
        - #40 - Events not displayed in Month View on Windows IE6. Default install would
          not display events in IE 6.  Rob Baker supplied fix.
        
        - #39 - Timezone issue when exporting to iCal. Issue is resolved. It was an old
          version of DateTime.py that caused the trouble. Replacing the file with the new
          version (available at zope.org) solved the problem.
        
        - #38 - Time formatting for internationalization. P4A Calendar now uses the i18n
          library to convert the hour/minute format to the locale based on the language
          of the incoming browser request.  This change removed several methods on the
          Month class that were formally handling this formatting chore.
          However, this new code does not have any tests written against it.
        
        - #36 - Event starting in the past, ending in the future is not listed.
          The submitter of the original bug supplied a patch. The patch was applied to the
          code base and tested. We concluded that the patch solves this issue.
        
        - #35 - KeyError causes month view to crash
        
        - #34 and #37 - Bug deals with a site breakage when the P4A product is removed
          from the file system. This occurs after marker interfaces are set on containerish
          objects. Rocky Burt concluded that this is a core Zope issue and provided a
          workaround is to remove all marker interfaces for P4A when uninstalling the
          product via the QuickInstaller. Reinstall does not affect the marker interface
          settings. The drawback is that if the product is uninstalled all site setting
          dealing with the calendar will be lost. But it was considered worse to have a
          product that breaks a site with its removal from the files system. The long term
          solution will have to come from Zope core.
        
        - #30 - Changing folder back to normal causes error.
        
        - #28 - Events with future month don't show up

          functionality is only available after this has been performed on the
