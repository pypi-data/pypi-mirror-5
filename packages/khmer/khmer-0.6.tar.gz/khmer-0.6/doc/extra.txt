**normalize-by-min.py**: do digital normalization (remove entirely
redundant sequences)

   Usage::

	normalize-by-min.py [ options ] <file1> <file2> ...

   Discard sequences based on whether or not their **minimum** k-mer
   abundance lies above a specified cutoff.  Kept sequences will be
   placed in <fileN>.keep.

   Note: this is, in theory, a loss-less operation.  Only sequences that
   contribute no novel k-mers will be discarded.

   **Do not use this script.** It will preferentially retain errors!

   Example::

	scripts/normalize-by-min.py -k 17 tests/test-data/test-abund-read-2.fa
