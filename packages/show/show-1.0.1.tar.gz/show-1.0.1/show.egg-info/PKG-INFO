Description: Simple, effective debug printing.
        
        Logging, assertions, unit tests, and
        interactive debuggers are all great development tools. But sometimes you
        just need to print values as a program runs to see what's going on. Every
        language has features to print text, but they're not really customized for
        printing debugging information. ``show`` is. It provides a simple, DRY
        mechanism to "show what's going on."

        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            from show import show
        
            x = 12
            nums = list(range(4))
        
            show(x, nums)
        
        yields::
        
            x: 12  nums: [0, 1, 2, 3]
        
        Debug Printing
        ==============
        
        Sometimes programs print so that users can see things, and sometimes they print
        so that develpopers can. ``show()`` is for developers, helping
        rapidly print the current state of variables. It replaces require the craptastic
        repetitiveness of::
        
            print "x: {0}".format(x)
        
        with::
        
            show(x)
        
        If you'd like to see where the data is being produced,::
        
            show.set(where=True)
        
        will turn on location reporting. This can also be set on call-by-call basis.
