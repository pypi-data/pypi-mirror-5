Description: ======================
        Evolutionary Petri Net
        ======================
        
        *Evolutionary Petri Nets* (EPN) is a convenient tool for the automatic 
        inference, optimization, and reverse engineering of Petri Nets (PNs). The 
        library exploits the evolutionary computation methodology described in [1].
        
        EPN can be used as follows:
        	
        	#!/usr/bin/env python
        
        	from epn.vpn import *
        	from epn.evolpn import *
        	from epn.basic import *
        
        	POPULATION = 10
        
        	E = EvolutionaryPetriNet()
        	E.setPopulationSize(POPULATION)
        	E.useTournament(size=2)
        	E.setIterations(100)
        	for p in range(POPULATION):
        		p = VirtualPetriNet("V"+str(p))
        		E.addVPN(p)
        		E.mutate()
        	E.setFitnessFunction( ... )
        	E.Optimize()
        	
        EPN can produce output figures of the PNs by using the dot/graphviz library. 
        For this reason, EPN relies on the external library pydot. The current state
        of the whole EPN can be outputted with the following command:
        
        	E.dumpToFile("output.png")
        
        
        Basics
        ======
        
        EPNs does not handles PN directly, but it exploits an extended class named 
        *Virtual Petri Net* (VPN). A population of VPNs undergoes an evolutionary 
        process, in which the best individuals are iteratively modified and improved
        by means of crossover and mutation operators. The evolutive pressure is driven
        by a user-defined fitness function.
        
        The programmer is given the freedom of choosing 
        
        * the population size;
        
        * one of the selection mechanism (roulette wheel, ranking, tournament);
        
        * the maximum number of iterations;
        
        * the pre- and post-order of transitions (see [1] for further information).
