Ryser - Latin Squares and Related Designs
=========================================

Ryser is a Python library for modelling latin squares and related designs. In
Ryser you will find components for building partial combinatorial structures
as well as algorithmic components for investigating the completability of
particular instances of such structures.

This is the main documentation page for Ryser. Here you can find links to
introductory material which explains the concepts behind Ryser, a tutorial which
demonstrates how to use Ryser as well as documentation for every module of Ryser
and tests of all those modules.
