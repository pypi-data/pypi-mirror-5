Description: Shoot
        =====
        
        Kick-start your prototype with Django templates
        
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        If you want to start prototyping your web app using Django templates,
        without needing to setup a complete Django project, *Shoot* does that for you.
        
        *Shoot* is a minimal web server which maps *.html files to URLs, i.e.
        server_root/path/to.file.html is served at http://host:port/path/to/file.
        
        HTML files are mapped to URLs and rendered as Django templates. You can use
        all the usual Django template goodness, i.e. extending & including other templates,
        template tags like *{% static %}* etc.
        
        It is like developing with PHP. You can later drop these templates directly into
        your Django project.
        
        *Shoot* is known to work with Python 3.2 and Django 1.5.
        
        Stuff *Shoot* does for you:
        
        - Map .html files to URLs and renders them while serving
        - List dirs and serve static files like any good web server would do
        - Let you pass custom context while rendering templates
        - Lets you pass custom Django settings module
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        On Ubuntu:
        
        You will need Pip with Python3::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
            $ sudo pip3 install shoot
            $ shoot
        
        
        Using git::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/pcx/shoot.git
            $ python3 shoot/setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run '*shoot*' in the directory you want to serve from.
        
        
        Custom Config
        -------------
        
        
        If the file *shootconfig.py* is present in the dir *shoot* is launched from, with contents::
        
            context = {}
        
        *shoot* will pass this dictionary to Context objects used in rendering templates. You can use this
        to expose a 'user' object in templates, etc.
        
        
        If the file *django_settings.py* is present in the dir *shoot* is launched from, *shoot*
        will use it as the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. You can use this for setting a custom static URL, etc.
        This file *must* contain the following variables::
        
            DEBUG = True
            TEMPLATE_DEBUG = True
            SECRET_KEY = "not-so-secret"
            # helps *shoot* find templates
            TEMPLATE_DIRS = (os.getcwd(),)
            # adds support for '*static*' template tag
            STATIC_URL = "/static/"
            INSTALLED_APPS = ('django.contrib.staticfiles',)
