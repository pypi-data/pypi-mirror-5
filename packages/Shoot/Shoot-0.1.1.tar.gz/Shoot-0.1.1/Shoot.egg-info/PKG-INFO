Description: Shoot
        =====
        
        Kick-start your prototype with Django templates
        
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        If you want to start prototyping your web app using Django templates,
        without needing to setup a complete Django project, *Shoot* does that for you.
        
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You will need Pip with Python3.
        
        On Ubuntu::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
            $ sudo pip3 install shoot
            $ shoot
        
        
        
        Custom Config
        -------------
        
        
        If the file *shootconfig.py* is present in the dir *shoot* is launched from, with contents::
        
            context = {}
        
        *shoot* will pass this dictionary to Context objects used in rendering templates
        
        
        If the file *django_settings.py* is present in the dir *shoot* is launched from, *shoot*
        will use it as the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. This file *must* contain the following variables::
        
            DEBUG = True
            TEMPLATE_DEBUG = True
            TEMPLATE_DIRS = (os.getcwd(),)
            SECRET_KEY = "not-so-secret"
            STATIC_URL = "/static/"
            INSTALLED_APPS = ('django.contrib.staticfiles',)
