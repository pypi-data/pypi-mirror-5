Description: Sesame: config file encryption
        ==============================
        
        Almost all applications have configuration of some kind, and often this config 
        is sensitive - database passwords, SMTP account details, API keys etc.
        
        These days it's common to use public source control; which means you can no
        longer store your application's sensitive config with your code.
        
        Sesame provides a simple way to encrypt (and decrypt) your application's config
        so it can be safely stored in public source control.
        
        
        Cryptography
        ------------
        
        Sesame leans on a little known project called `keyczar <http://www.keyczar.org/>`_,
        which was originally built by members of the Google Security Team.
        
        Keyczar in turn builds upon `pycrypto <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto>`_,
        and aims to provide sane defaults for your crypto.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install sesame, simply:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install sesame
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The interface to Sesame is intended to be as simple as possible. There are only two
        commands: ``encrypt`` and ``decrypt`` and each of these has only two parameters
        available: ``config`` and ``keyfile``.
        
        When calling ``encrypt`` the keyfile parameter is optional - if you do not supply it,
        Sesame will prompt you to generate a new key.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ sesame -h
            usage: sesame encrypt [-h] -c CONFIG [-k KEYFILE]
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                                    Path to your app config
              -k KEYFILE, --keyfile KEYFILE
                                    Path to keyczar encryption key
        
        
        Flask Bindings
        --------------
        
        When using `Flask-Script <http://flask-script.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ you
        can benefit from (almost) automatic integration:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # create your Flask app and Flask-Script manager as usual
            app = Flask("test")
            manager = Manager(app)
        
            # include the sesame manager
            from sesame.flask.script import manager as sesame_manager
            manager.add_command("sesame", sesame_manager)
        
        Then sesame's encrypt/decrypt commands are available via your manage script:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ./manage.py sesame
            Please provide a command:
            Encrypt/decrypt Flask application config
                decrypt  Decrypt a config file
                encrypt  Encrypt a config file
