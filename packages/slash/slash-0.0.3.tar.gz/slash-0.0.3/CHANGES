0.0.2 (Under development)
=========================
New Features:

- #46: Added plugin.activate() to provide plugins with the ability to control what happens upon activation
- #40: Added test context support - you can now decorate tests to provide externally implemented contexts for more flexible setups
- Renamed slash.fixture to slash.g (fixture is an overloaded term that will maybe refer to test contexts down the road)
- #48, #54: handle import errors and improve captured exceptions
- #3: Handle KeyboardInterrupts (quit fast), added the test_interrupt hook
- #5: add_critical_cleanup for adding cleanups that are always called (even on interruptions)
