        =====================
        
        This is a `Buildout <https://github.com/buildout/buildout>`_ recipe that can
        download, install and configure one or several OpenERP servers, web clients,
        gtk clients and addons modules, from official or custom sources, or any bzr,
        hg, git or svn repositories.  It currently supports versions 6.0, 6.1 and 7.0,
        with gunicorn deployment and an additional cron worker. It works under Linux
        and MacOs. It might work under Windows but it is untested.
        
        For a **quickstart** you can jump to the howto_ section.
        
        A "Buildout recipe" is the engine behind a Buildout "part". A "buildout part"
        is a part of a larger application built with the Buildout sandbox build system.
        Using Buildout is harmless for your system because it is entirely
        self-contained in a single directory: just delete the directory and the
        buildout is gone. You never have to use administrative rights, except for
        build dependencies.

        Recipes
        ~~~~~~~
        
        You get 3 recipes at once. The recipe to use is the following:
        
        For the server::
        
            recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:server
        
        For the web client::
        
            recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:webclient
        
        For the gtk client::
        
            recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:gtkclient
        
        Default options from zc.recipe.egg
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This recipe reuses the *zc.recipe.egg:scripts* recipe, so the options
        are the same (*eggs*, *interpreter*, etc.), and some changes, documented below.
        
        Consult the documentation here http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg
        
        The main useful ones are below:
        
        eggs
        ----
        
        Starting from version 0.16 of the recipe, you don't need to put anything in
        this option by default. But you may specify additional eggs needed by addons,
        or just useful ones::
        
            eggs = 
                ipython
                openobject-library
        
        scripts
        -------
        .. note:: for scripts needing to call OpenERP internal API or to load
                  an OpenERP database prior to execution, check
                  ``openerp_scripts`` below.
        
        The behaviour of this option is slightly modified :
        by default, no script other than those directly related to OpenERP are
        generated, but you may specify some explicitely, with the same semantics as the
        normal behaviour (we simply set an empty default value, which means to not
        produce scripts)::
        
                scripts =
                    change_tz
        
        In the current state, beware to *not* require the same script in different
        parts or rename them. See
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/anybox.recipe.openerp/+bug/1020967 for
        details.
        
        interpreter
        -----------
        With the ``gtklcient`` and ``webclient`` recipes,
        this is the default `interpreter` option of `zc.recipe.egg` that
        specifies the name of the Python interpreter that shoud be included in
        the``bin`` directory of the buildout::
        
            interpreter = erp_python
        
        With the ``server`` recipe, the ``interpreter`` option will be ignored,
        because it always creates an interpreter with preloaded objects to
        bootstrap openerp. Check the ``interpreter_name`` option below for
        more details.
        
        
        Specific options
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The recipe also adds a few specific options:
        
        version
        -------
        
        Specifies the OpenERP version to use. It can be:
        
        The **version number** of an official OpenERP (server, web client or gtk client)::
        
          version = 6.0.3
        
        A **custom download**::
        
          version = url http://example.com/openerp.tar.gz
        
        An absolute or a relative **path**::
        
          version = path /my/path/to/a/custom/openerp
        
        A custom **bzr, hg, git or svn** branch or repository. The syntax is the same
        as the `addons` option (see below)::
        
          version = bzr lp:openobject-server/6.1 openerp61 last:1
        
        A **nightly** build::
        
          version = nightly 6.1 20120814-233345
        
        or (dangerously unpinned version)::
        
          version = nightly 6.1 latest
        
        or even more dangerous::
        
          version = nightly trunk latest
        
        
        addons
        ------
        
        Specifies additional OpenERP addons, either a local path or a repository.
        
        Example::
        
          addons = local ../some/relative/path/for/custom_addons/
                   local /some/other/absolute/path/for/custom_addons
                   bzr lp:openobject-addons/trunk/    addons0 last:1
                   hg  http://example.com/some_addons addons1 default
                   git http://example.com/some_addons addons2 master
                   svn http://example.com/some_addons addons3 head
                   bzr lp:openerp-web/trunk/ openerp-web last:1 subdir=addons
        
        When using ``local`` paths you can either specify a directory holding
        addons, or a single addon. In that latter case, it will be actually
        placed one directory below.
        
        .. warning::
        
           Never name one of these addons directory simply ``addons``. It
           leads to obscure and blocking install errors for addons in other
           directories, claiming that some files don't exist while they do.
        
        For remote repositories, the syntax is:
        
        ``TYPE  URL  DESTINATION  REVISION  [OPTIONS]``
        
        * *TYPE* can be ``bzr``, ``hg``, ``git`` or ``svn``
        * *URL* is any URL scheme supported by the versionning tool
        * *DESTINATION* is the local directory that will be created (relative or absolute)
        * *REVISION* is any version specification supported (revision, tag, etc.)
        * *OPTIONS* take the form ``name=value``. Currently the ``subdir``
          option is recognized. If used, the given subdirectory of the
          repository is registered as an addons directory.
        
        Repositories are updated on each build according to the specified
        revision. You must be careful with the revision specification.
        
        Buildout offline mode is supported. In that case, update to the
        specified revision is performed, if the VCS allows it (Subversion does
        not).
        
        .. note:: An additional option is supported for bzr. **'bzr-init'**
                  defines the way the bzr branch
                  is initialized for addons or server declared with a bzr
                  repository path.
        
                  Possible values:
        
                  branch (default)
                    Working copy initialized with the command
                    ``bzr branch url ...``
                  stacked-branch
                   Working copy initialized with the command
                   ``bzr branch --stacked url ...``
        
                  lightweight-checkout
                    Working copy initialized with the command
                    ``bzr checkout --lightweight url ...``
        
        revisions
        ---------
        
        This option allows to further precise what has been specified through
        the  ``addons`` and ``version`` options by fixing VCS revisions.
        
        The main use-case it to apply it in an extension buildout
        configuration file::
        
           [buildout]
           extends = base.cfg
        
           [openerp]
           revisions = 4320  ; main software
                       addons-openerp 7109
        
        As you can see in that example, the first token is the target
        filesystem path, as in the ``addons`` option, the second one is the
        revision, except in the case of the main software (if VCS based), for
        which there's no filesystem path.
        
        Some interesting use-cases:
        
        * temporary fixing some revision in cas of upstream regression with no
          impact on your main development configuration (no risk to commit an
          unwanted freeze if the main configuration is itself versionned).
        * freezing satisfactory revisions in a release process (the recipe can
          do that automatically for you, see ``freeze-to`` option below).
        
        clean
        -----
        
        If set to true, this option will clean remove python object files from
        the main server part and addons before any update or install.
        
        Note that tarball downloads get re-extracted afresh in any case.
        
        openerp_scripts
        ---------------
        
        Introduction and use-cases
        ``````````````````````````
        This option lets you install console scripts provided by any of the loaded eggs,
        so that they can access to OpenERP internals and load databases.
        Some interesting use-cases:
        
        * specific batch jobs
        * introspection tools
        * general-purposes test launchers that don't have any knowledge of
          OpenERP specifics
        * actually, the main startup scripts themselves (with a default
          configuration, of course)
        
        Usage
        `````
        This multiline option is similar to the classical ``scripts`` options
        of ``zc.recipe.eggs:scripts``. It lets you ask for installation of
        console scripts provided by the various Python distribution involved
        in the buildout part (including OpenERP itself).
        
        The built console scripts can import all the involved Python
        distributions, and have access to a ``session`` object, to issue
        OpenERP native calls (see
        ``interpreter_name`` option below for details on how to use it).
        
        One has to register exactly one console script per line.
        
        As it is the case with ``scripts``, one actually specifies the name of the
        entry point to use (we are all used to that entry point being the name
        of the resulting script, because that's what ``setup.py install`` does).
        
        Suppose there is a distribution ``my.package`` with the following lines in
        its ``setup.py``::
        
              entry_points="""
        
              [console_scripts]
              my = my.package.main:run
              """
        
        Now the following configuration extract builds a script called
        ``my_openerp1``, that can access ``session``::
        
          [openerp1]
          (...)
          openerp_scripts = my
        
        To control the script name, just do, e.g,::
        
          [openerp1]
          (...)
          openerp_scripts = my=my_script
        
        This will build it as ``bin/my_script``.
        
        Command-line options and test launchers
        ```````````````````````````````````````
        
        If ``my.package`` is meant to do OpenERP heavy-lifting, then surely it
        will provide a powerful command-line parsing. e.g., to let the end user chose
        the database on which to work, etc.
        
        Sometimes, however, the script itself has no knowledge of OpenERP at
        all, but still must run after a database has been fully initialized.
        The main use case for this is test launchers, such as
        `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ or simply ``unit2``.
        For these, the recipe has a facility to rewrap the script and add some further
        command-line options.
        
        In this example, we build ``unit2``, the launcher that comes with
        ``unittest2``, and wrap it to add the database option::
        
          [openerp]
          (...)
          openerp_scripts = unit2 command-line-options=-d
        
        You may then run it this way::
        
           bin/unit2_openerp -d unit-tests-db -- discover some/addon
        
        Notice how ``--`` is used to separate the ``-d`` or
        any recipe-related options from the options expected by the script itself.
        
        If one wishes to run the tests with ``nose``, one has further to
        require it. In the following example, we also ask for the ``coverage``
        package::
        
          [openerp]
          (...)
          eggs = nose
                 coverage
          openerp_scripts = nosetests command-line-options=-d
        
        Here's our test run with coverage and pdb post-mortem::
        
          bin/nosetests-openerp -d unit-tests-db -- --nologcapture \
                   --with-coverage --pdb \
                   some/addon/tests/test_one.py
        
        Main startup scripts
        ````````````````````
        The recipe will in all cases build OpenERP startup scripts, according to other
        configuration options (gunicorn, tests etc.). These are
        actually special cases of the scripts controlled via ``openerp_scripts``.
        
        This allows you (for now) to control the names. For instance, to
        replace ``bin/start_openerp`` with ``bin/oerp``, just do::
        
          [openerp]
          (...)
          openerp_scripts = openerp_starter=oerp
        
        Here's the list of currently available internal entry points. For
        these, the ``command-line-options`` modifier has no effect.
        
        :openerp_starter: main OpenERP startup script (dynamically added
                          behing the scenes by the recipe)
        :openerp_tester: uniform script to start OpenERP, launch all tests and
                         exit. This can be achieved with the main startup
                         scripts, but options differ among OpenERP versions.
                         (also dynamically added behind the scenes).
        :openerp_cron_worker: entry point for the cron worker script that gets
                              built for gunicorn setups.
        :oe: entry point declared by ``openerp-command`` and used by the recipe.
        :gunicorn: entry point declared ``gunicorn`` and used by the recipe.
        
        script_name
        -----------
        
        .. warning:: as of version 1.7.0, this option is deprecated because of its
                     redundancy with ``openerp_scripts``.
        
        OpenERP startup scripts are created in the `bin` directory. By default the name is:
        start_<part_name>, so you can have several startup scripts for each part if you
        configure several OpenERP servers or clients. You can pass additional typical
        arguments to the server via the startup script, such as -i or -u options.
        
        You can choose another name for the script by using the *script_name*
        option ::
        
            script_name = start_erp  
        
        interpreter_name
        ----------------
        
        The recipe will automatically create a python interpreter with a
        ``session`` object that can bootstrap OpenERP with a database right
        away. You can use that for interactive sessions or to launch a script::
        
            $ bin/python_openerp
            To start the OpenERP working session, just do:
               session.open()
            or
               session.open(db=DATABASE_NAME)
            Then you can issue commands such as
               session.registry('res.users').browse(session.cr, 1, 1)
        
            >>>
        
        The interpreter name is  ``python_<part_name>`` by default; but it can
        be explicitely set like this::
        
            interpreter_name = my_py
        
        If you want *not* to have the interpreter, juste do
        
            interpreter_name =
        
        The bootstrapping facility may also be used within a script installed
        by an egg; just insert this in your code to get the session object as
        if you were in the interpreter::
        
            from anybox.recipe.openerp.startup import Session
            session = Session()
        
        .. note:: this facility is new in version 1.6.0, and tested with
                  OpenERP 7 only for now.
        
        startup_delay
        -------------
        
        Specifies a delay in seconds to wait before actually launching OpenERP. This
        option was a preliminary hack to support both gunicorn instance and a legacy
        instance.  The Gunicorn startup script (see below) itself is not affected by
        this setting ::
        
            startup_delay = 3
        
        with_devtools
        -------------
        Allows to load development and install useful devlopment and testing
        tools, notably the following scripts:
        
        * ``test_openerp``: a uniform test launcher for all supported
          versions. See test_script_name option below for details.
        * ``openerp_command``: see openerp_command_name option below for
          details. Not installed for OpenERP major versions less than or equal to 6.1.
        
        This option is False by default, hence it's activated this way::
        
            with_devtools = true
        
        It will also add some dependencies that are typical to development
        setups (tests related packages etc.) and automatically load where
        needed helpers, such as `anybox.testing.datetime
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anybox.testing.datetime>`_ (allows to
        cheat with system time).
        
        test_script_name
        ----------------
        .. warning:: as of version 1.7.0, this option is deprecated because of its
                     redundancy with ``openerp_scripts``.
        
        If the ``with_devtools`` is set to True, the recipe will create a
        test script, which is named by default ``test_<part_name>``. You may
        override the name in the configuration as in the following example::
        
          test_script_name = test_erp
        
        The test script takes the same arguments as the regular startup
        script::
        
          bin/test_openerp --help
          bin/test_openerp -d test_db -i purchase,sale
        
        At the time of this writing, all this script does compared to the
        regular startup script is to bring uniformity across OpenERP versions
        by tweaking options internally.
        
        base_url
        --------
        
        URL from which to download official and nightly versions
        (assuming the archive filenames are constistent with those in
        OpenERP download server). This is a basic mirroring capability::
        
            base_url = http://download.example.com/openerp/
        
        openerp-downloads-directory
        ---------------------------
        
        Allows to share OpenERP downloads among several buildouts. You should put this
        option in your ``~/.buildout/default.cfg`` file.  It specifies the destination
        download directory for OpenERP archives. The path may be absolute or relative
        to the buildout directory.
        
        Example::
        
            [buildout]
            openerp-downloads-directory = /home/user/.buildout/openerp-downloads
        
        gunicorn
        --------
        
        Gunicorn integration is only supported on OpenERP >= 6.1.
        Any value of this option makes the recipe generate a script to start
        OpenERP with Gunicorn and (*new in version 1.1*) a dedicated script to
        handle cron jobs.
        
        For OpenERP 6.1, the only accepted values are ``direct`` and
        ``proxied``. Any value is suitable for OpenERP >= 7
        
        Proxied mode
        ````````````
        For OpenERP 6.1, a special value of the ``gunicorn`` option is to be
        used if you plan to run Gunicorn behind a reverse proxy::
        
            gunicorn = proxied
        
        This behaviour has been kept for OpenERP >= 7 to keep
        backwards compatibility, but the option is now superseded by the
        general ``proxy_mode`` option of the server. In the buildout context,
        that'd be::
        
            options.proxy_mode = True
        
        
        Gunicorn options
        ````````````````
        
        Gunicorn-specific options are to be specified with the ``gunicorn.``
        prefix and will end up in the the Gunicorn python configuration file
        ``etc/gunicorn_<part_name>.conf.py``, such as::
        
          gunicorn.workers = 8
        
        If you don't specify ``gunicorn.bind``, then a value is constructed
        from the relevant options for the OpenERP script (currently
        ``options.xmlrpc_port`` and ``options.xmlrpc_interface``).
        
        Other supported options and their default values are::
        
          gunicorn.workers = 4
          gunicorn.timeout = 240
          gunicorn.max_requests = 2000
        
        The recipe sets the proper WSGI entry point according to OpenERP
        version, you may manually override that with an option::
        
          gunicorn.entry_point = mypackage:wsgi.app
        
        Finally, you can specify the Gunicorn script name with the
        ``gunicorn_script_name`` option. The configuration file will be named
        accordingly.
        
        openerp_command_name
        --------------------
        .. warning:: as of version 1.7.0, this option is deprecated, check
           ``openerp_scripts`` for more details.
        
        OpenERP Command Line Tools (openerp-command for short) is an
        alternative set of command-line tools that may someday subsede the
        current monolithic startup script. Currently experimental, but
        already very useful in development mode.
        
        It is currently enabled if the ``with_devtools`` option is on.
        
        This works by requiring the ``openerp-command`` python
        distribution, which is not on PyPI as of this writting. You may want
        to use the ``vcsdevelop`` extension to get it from Launchpad::
        
          [buildout]
          extensions = gp.vcsdevelop
          vcs-extend-develop = bzr+http://bazaar.launchpad.net/openerp/openerp-command#egg=openerp-command
        
        As for other scripts, you can control its name of the produced script, e.g::
        
          openerp_command_name = oe
        
        the name defaults otherwise to ``<part_name>_command``. Note that
        ``oe`` is the classical name for this script outside of the realm of
        this buildout recipe.
        
        .. warning::
        
          Do not use to launch production servers, especially in an automatic
          way, openerp-command is really unstable and that may damage your
          installation.
        
        freeze-to
        ---------
        
        This option is meant to produce an extension buildout configuration
        that effectively freezes the variable versions and revisions of the
        current configuration.
        
        .. note:: supported VCSes for this feature are currently Mercurial,
                  Bazaar and Git (excluding Subversion).
        
        It is meant for release processes, and as such includes some
        consistency checks to avoid as much as possible issuing a frozen
        configuration that could be different from what the developper or
        release manager is assumed to have just tested. Namely:
        
        * it works only in offline mode (command-line ``-o`` flag). This is to
          avoid fetching new revisions from VCSes or PyPI
        * it fails if some VCS-controlled addons or main software have local
          modifications, including pending merges.
        
        The recommended way to use it is through the command line (all
        buildout options can be set this way). Here's an example, assuming the
        part is called ``openerp-server-1``::
        
            bin/buildout -o openerp-server-1:freeze-to=frozen.cfg
        
        This produces a buildout configuration file named ``frozen.cfg``,
        with notably an ``openerp-server-1`` part having a ``revisions`` option that
        freezes everything.
        
        For configurations with several openerp related parts, you can freeze
        them together or in different files. This gives you flexibility in the
        distributions you may want to produce from a single configuration file::
        
           bin/buildout -o openerp-server-1:freeze-to=server.cfg openerp-server-2:freeze-to=server.cfg gtkclient:freeze-to=client.cfg
        
        In that latter example, ``server.cfg`` will have the two server parts,
        while ``client.cfg`` will have the ``gtkclient`` part only.
        
        .. note:: in DVCSes cases, nothing is done to check that the locally
                  extracted revisions are actually pushed where they should.
        
                  Also, if the buildout configuration is itself under version
                  control (a good practice), it is not in the recipe scope to
                  commit or tag it.
                  You are encouraged to use an external release script for
                  that kind of purpose.
        
        .. warning:: the recipe will also freeze python distributions installed
                     with the ``gp.vcsdevelop`` extension but cannot currently
                     protect against local modifications of these.
        
        .. warning:: currently ``freeze-to`` cannot fix eggs versions related
                     to non-openerp parts.
        
        freeze-allow-picked-versions
        ----------------------------
        
        This option is to be used in conjunction with ``freeze-to``. If set to
        ``False``, it will add ``allow-picked-versions = false``
        for ``zc.buildout`` versions that support this flag.
        
        .. warning:: in the current state of things, this can cause problems
                     if you have non-openerp parts (see warning in ``freeze-to``
                     documentation).
        
        
        extract-downloads-to
        --------------------
        
        Following the same kind of logic as ``freeze-to``, this option allows
        to turn a buildout that aggregates from various remote sources
        (tarball downloads, VCSes) into a self-contained buildout archive
        directory that can be packed for easy distribution.
        
        .. note:: supported VCSes for this feature are currently Mercurial,
                  Bazaar and Git (excluding Subversion).
        
        Actually it extracts only the downloaded elements into a target
        directory and issues a buildout configuration with local references
        only. If that target directory has been itself initialized first with
        the *fixed elements* (buildout configuration files, bootstrap scripts,
        local addons), then it has all the needed elements, except eggs to
        be downloaded from PyPI or the specified index site.
        
        Here is an example, assuming the *fixed elements* are themselves versioned
        with Mercurial::
        
          hg archive ../test-extract && bin/buildout -o openerp:extract-downloads-to=../test-extract
        
        The produced buildout configuration in the target directory is
        ``release.cfg``. So, for instance, from our ``test-extract`` archive,
        the buildout can be executed like this::
        
          python bootstrap.py && bin/buildout -c release.cfg
        
        or further extended for system-dependent options such as port, db
        connection, etc.
        
        The ``extract-downloads-to`` options can be used for several parts
        with the same target directory (same as ``freeze-to``).
        
        Furthermore, a default ``freeze-to`` is issued, producing a buildout
        configuration called ``extracted_from.cfg`` in the target directory,
        for later reference (local modification tracking) or a more
        developper-friendly reproduction configuration (ready-made setup to
        derive bugfix branches from).
        
        This implication of ``freeze-to`` also has the side effect to enforce the
        same rules with respect to uncommitted changes.
        
        Python distributions managed with ``gp.vcsdevelop`` are taken into account.
        
        
        OpenERP options
        ---------------
        
        You can define OpenERP options directly from the buildout file (usually
        ``buildout.cfg``) in the recipe section.
        The OpenERP configuration files are generated by OpenERP itself in the directory
        specified by ``etc-directory`` which defaults to the `etc` directory under your
        buildout directory.
        The settings of the OpenERP configuration files can be controlled using a
        dotted notation prefixed by the name of the corresponding section of the
        OpenERP config file. The specified options will just overwrite the existing
        options in the corresponding config files. You don't have to replicate all the
        options in your section of the buildout file.  If a setting or a section does
        not natively exist in the openerp config file, it can be created from there for
        your application.
        
        For example you can specify the xmlrpc port for the server or
        even an additional option that does not exist in the default config file::
        
          options.xmlrpc_port = 8069
          options.additional_option = "foobar"
        
        It will end-up in the server config as::
        
          [options]
          xmlrpc_port = 8069
          additional_option = "foobar"
        
        For the web client you can specify the company url with::
        
          global.server.socket_port = 8080
          openerp-web.company.url = 'http://anybox.fr'
        
        It will modify the corresponding web client config::
        
          [global]
          server.socket_port = 8080
        
          [openerp-web]
          company.url = 'http://anybox.fr'
        
        
        .. note:: Note that for security reason, the superadmin password is not set by
            default. If you want to create a database you should temporary set it manually
            in the etc/openerp.conf file
        
        
        
        .. _howto:
        
        How to create and bootstrap a buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To create a buildout and run the build, you just need **1 file** and **2 commands**:
        
        - Create a single ``buildout.cfg`` file.
        - Be sure you installed all your build dependencies
        - Bootstrap the buildout with: ``python bootstrap.py``
        - Run the build with: ``bin/buildout``
        
        The same with more details below :
        
        Creating the buildout
        ---------------------
        
        Create a ``buildout.cfg`` file in an empty directory, containing the
        configuration of the `example 6.1`_ section.
        
        .. _dependencies:
        
        Installing build dependencies
        -----------------------------
        
        You basically need typical development tools needed to build all the Python
        dependency eggs of OpenERP. You can do this by yourself with your system or
        Linux distribution.
        
        Or if you're using a Debian system, we provide a single dependency package you
        can use to install all dependencies in one shot:
        
        Add the following line in your ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::
        
          deb http://apt.anybox.fr/openerp common main
        
        Install the dependency package::
        
          $ sudo aptitude update 
          $ sudo aptitude install openerp-server-system-build-deps
        
        You can uninstall this package with `aptitude` after the build to
        automatically remove all un-needed dependencies, but you need to
        install *run dependencies* before that ::
        
          $ sudo aptitude install openerp-server-system-run-deps
          $ sudo aptitude remove openerp-server-system-build-deps
        
        Please note that these package will have your system install the
        *client* part of PostgreSQL software only. If you want a
        PostgreSQL server on the same host, that's not in the recipe scope,
        just install it as well.
        
        Bootstrapping the buildout
        --------------------------
        
        Bootstrapping the buildout consists in creating the basic structure of the buildout, and installing buildout itself in the directory.
        
        The easiest and recommended way to bootstrap is to use a ``bootstrap.py`` script::
        
          $ wget https://raw.github.com/buildout/buildout/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
          $ python bootstrap.py
        
        As an alternative and more complicated solution, you may also bootstrap by
        creating a virtualenv, installing zc.buildout, then run the bootstrap::
        
          $ virtualenv sandbox
          $ sandbox/bin/pip install zc.buildout
          $ sandbox/bin/buildout bootstrap
        
        Running the build
        -----------------
        
        Just run ::
        
          $ bin/buildout
        
        Starting OpenERP
        ----------------
        
        Just run ::
        
          $ bin/start_openerp
        
        
        .. _example 6.1:

        Other sample buildouts
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here are a few ready-to-use buildouts:
        
        (Be sure to install system dependencies_ first)
        
        OpenERP with the development branches of the Magento connector addons::
        
          $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/anybox/openerp_connect_magento_buildout
          $ cd openerp_connect_magento_buildout
          $ python bootstrap.py
          $ bin/buildout
          $ bin/start_openerp
        
        OpenERP with the development branches of the Prestashop connector addons::
        
          $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/anybox/openerp_connect_prestashop_buildout
          $ cd openerp_connect_prestashop_buildout
          $ python bootstrap.py
          $ bin/buildout
          $ bin/start_openerp
        
        Other examples are available in the ``buildbot`` subdirectory of the
        source distribution archive of this recipe (the ``tar.gz`` file that
        can be downloaded `from the PyPI
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anybox.recipe.openerp>`_), and are
        continuously tested in the
        `anybox buildbot <http://buildbot.anybox.fr/>`_ which is powered by
        `anybox.buildbot.openerp <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anybox.buildbot.openerp>`_.

        1.7.1 (2013-09-07)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1215838: don't freeze develop / gp.vcsdevelop distributions
        - launchpad #1213469: openerp scripts: support for entry point
          arguments
        - launchpad #1215833: preserve regular develops in extract-downloads-to
        - launchpad #1215873: [git] re-buildout with revision fixed versions crashes
        - launchpad #1217816: [bzr] proper update of lightweight checkouts
        - launchpad #1203550: [v8] using the openerpcommand that comes now bundled
          with openobject-server
        - launchpad MP #182002: new 'etc-directory' option (default behaviour

        - launchpad #1216498: fixed python interpreter extra paths
        - launchpad #1216835: [bzr] mispelling in 'lightweight-checkout' option
        - launchpad #1205063: no more error if no addons are specified (might
          lead to problems with the default config, though, because of server
          wide modules, but that's supposed to be overridable)
        
        
        1.7.0 (2013-07-26)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1189160: easy integration of general purpose unit test launchers
        - launchpad #1201715: allow easily working in a virtualenv with extra-requires
          on bzr (allows easily to work with zc.buildout 2.2 on systems providing

        - [bzr] support for lightweight checkout, with uniform 'bzr-init' option
        - launchpad #1204573: [bzr] retry in two steps for some bzr branching
          cases where it fails to branch directly to wished revision.
        - launchpad #1128146: new option in ``freeze-to`` to disallow picked
          versions, stopping not freezing of distribute.
        - introduced ``vcs.base.CloneError`` with wrappers for ``check_call``
          and ``check_output``.
        
        1.6.4 (2013-07-14)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1200198: hg: determination whether rev spec is fixed could be wrong

        1.6.3 (2013-06-23)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1192973: 'clean' option now based on bzr clean-tree (more 
          powerful, and avoids in particular removing empty dirs, which is a local
          modification that prevents later on freezing)
        
        1.6.2 (2013-06-15)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1189402: order of the addons_path is now deterministic
        - launchpad #1189162: registry helping avoid double evaluaton of
          custom addons models (helps launching unittest2 tests directly)
        - launchpad #1191279: first implementation of new 'clean' option,
          dealing with python object files only.
        
        1.6.1 (2013-06-06)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1188402: fixed git clone init on a precise revision
        
        1.6.0 (2013-05-30)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1183005: python interpreter that can bootstrap OpenERP
          and open a database for interactive session or to launch a script.
        - launchpad #1182589: avoid IOError if a bzr branch has no branch.conf
        - launchpad #1185097, #1185100, #1185101, #1185741: advanced support
          for Git (precise revision, freeze, extract) allows including Git
          repositories in a full release process for tarball deployments.
        
        1.5.5 (2013-05-20)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1182146: clearer user feedback and exit status code = 17

        1.5.4 (2013-05-14)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1169124: regression: offline mode not honoured with bzr
        
        1.5.3 (2013-04-11)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1166788: regression with bzr "revid:" revision specifications
        
        1.5.2 (2013-04-06)
        ------------------
        - launchpad #1154719: freeze-to does not take the correct bzr revision number
        - launchpad #1133248: "need more than 1 value to unpack" if some bzr's
          branch.conf has extra content not in the key = value form
        - support for bzr stacked branches for the server branch in the same
          way as was already done in addons.
        - launchpad #1152808: corrected parsing of options.log_handler in
          gunicorn setups (introduced a constant to treat comma-separated list
          options in gunicorn conf)
        - launchpad #1153036: avoid pulls in case the specified revision is
          a fixed one that we already have (bzr and hg only)
        - launchpad #1115504: extract-downloads-to now works with bzr version
          shipping with Debian squeeze

        1.5.0 (14-02-2013)
        ------------------
        
        - works with zc.buildout 2.0
        - launchpad #1115503: now it's possible to apply ``extract-downloads-to``
          for a buildout configuration that uses the ``revisions`` option: the
          produced configuration resets ``revisions`` if needed.
        - launchpad #1122015: soft requirements problem if offline on zc.buildout 2.0
        - quality: now entirely flake8 compliant

        - launchpad #1093474: freeze feature of revisions and versions of
          python distributions

          scripts
        - launchpad #1096472: forbid standalone (single) local addons. A local
          addon must always be a directory that has addons inside.
        - launchpad #1096472: trailing slash in a standalone addon directory name
          led to error.

          dependency to PIL in OpenERP 7
        - launchpad #1055466: refactor version logic by providing major
          version tuple for comparisons.
        - launchpad #1081039: introduced soft requirements and made
