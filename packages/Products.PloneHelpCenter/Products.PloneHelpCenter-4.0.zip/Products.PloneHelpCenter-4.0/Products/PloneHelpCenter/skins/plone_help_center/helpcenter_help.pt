            A brief description of how you use and contribute to the Help Center.
            </p>

            <p>
            Welcome to the Help Center! This way of doing documentation is a bit
            different from what you may be used to, so please read this document
            to understand how to contribute.
            </p>

            <h2>Quick Start</h2>

            <p>For the impatient, here's the bare minimum you should know:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>You normally need to be logged in.</li>

                <li>There are several different documentation types, most are
                    self-explanatory, but pay attention to the difference between a
                    <strong>How-to</strong> and a <strong>Tutorial</strong> (explained
                    below).
                </li>

                <li>To add a piece of documentation/help, go into the relevant section,
                    <strong>make sure there isn't already an existing entry about what
                    you want to add</strong>,
                    and use the button at the top right to add (normally says <code>Add
                    FAQ</code> or similar).
                </li>

                <li>Add your content, and save it. This edit/view cycle can be
                    performed as many times as you like, until you are happy with the
                    result.
                </li>

                <li>Make sure you <code>Submit</code> your document for publication
                    when you are done &mdash; top right pulldown in the content area.
                </li>

                <li>A reviewer will then pick up the document, and publish it unless
                    the content needs to be improved.
                </li>

                <li>If somebody adds comments to your entry later, you will be notified
                    by e-mail.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>What type of item is my documentation?</h2>

            <p>Below is a description, usage and example for each type.</p>

                    An FAQ is a short question with a 1-2 paragraph answer. You can add several
                    questions to a FAQ area and group the questions into sections.

                        <strong>Question:</strong> What is Plone?

                        <p>
                        <strong>Answer:</strong>
                        Plone is an open source Enterprise Content Management
                        System (ECM/CMS) that runs on top of Zope and CMF.

                <dd>
                    <p>
                    A HowTo is a one-page description on how to accomplish something, but is
            folderish, so Files/Images can be attached. It's usually very brief and to-the-point.

                    A tutorial is a multi-paged article with lots of detail. The tutorial
                    is more in-depth than a How-to, and may cover the conceptual aspects
                    of the task, in addition to the practical steps to get the job done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you are unsure of the difference of a How-to and a Tutorial, think
                    about it as the difference between a recipe that only teaches you
                    what ingredients are needed, and how to bake the cake (How-to),
                    and an article telling you about the history behind cakes in general,
                    that may or may not teach you how to actually bake one (Tutorial).

                        A help link is a link (either external or internal). It is
            different from a standard Plone link in that it can have section
            and version information.
