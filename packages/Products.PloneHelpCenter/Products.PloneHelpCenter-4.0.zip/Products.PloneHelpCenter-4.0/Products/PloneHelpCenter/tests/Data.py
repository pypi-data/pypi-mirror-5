.. _Plone: http://www.plone.org/

This howto is a document that starts inthe published state and is only
attached to one Section.
The rest of the content below this description was basically stolen from
the CVS tutorial on Plone.org just to give us a non-trivial document.
It is one of the few reStructured Text documents for which I have the
source format.

Section 1
=========

This document was spawned from conversations on the #plone IRC channel.
A new version of the PloneHelpCenter from the Plone_ Collective was
undergoing testing, but some developers wanted to start working on brand
new code.  The danger was that the new code would delay the deployment
of some of the much-needed bug fixes and changes that were almost ready
for deployment on plone.org.  The obivous choice was to create a branch,
but no one seemed comfortable enough with CVS to make a branch.  I
volunteered to make a minimal HOWTO that would explain the essential
CVS commands for getting day to day work done, up to and including
creating branches and merging code between branches.

I assume that you are familiar with revision control in general and
have CVS client software installed and working.  We just provide a
quick explanation of the most common commands that you will need.  While
there are some great CVS GUIs (Win CVS, Tortois CVS, Cervisia, etc.),
I will only cover the cvs command line here.

Please see the end of this document for links to more complete CVS
documentation and to some useful CVS tools.

General syntax
--------------

CVS command line syntax looks like this::

    cvs [global-options] command [command-options] [command-arguments]

The ``command`` is one of the CVS commands, such as checkout, update, or
commit.  To see a brief list of the available commands, use the
following option::

    cvs --help-commands

The ``global-options`` are the same for all commands.  Each command has
a different set of ``command-options`` and ``command-arguments``.

The most common ``global-options`` are listed here for later reference.

``-d``
    specifies the root of the CVS tree and possibly also identifies a
    remote repository, account name, and connection method for the
    remote repository; overrides the CVSROOT environment variable;
    generally only used with the checkout command (after that, cvs
    reads this information from the CVS/Root file in your personal
    copy of the files)
``-n``
    do not execute anything that would change the disk; for many commands,
    this options shows what would be done, but does not actually do it
``-z``
    specifies a compression level for network traffic; recommended for
    remote repositories


Section 2
=========

How to get a local copy of code for a Product from the Plone_ Collective.

The CVS command to get a local working copy of code from a central CVS
repository is ``checkout``.  This command is normally abbreviated as ``co``.
This command will give you a copy of all of the files of a directory
tree on your machine.  This local copy is sometimes called your
sandbox (you get to play in your sandbox).  A checkout works on a module,
which will just be a top-level folder in the Collective for our purposes.


You just want the latest version of a Product
---------------------------------------------

If you do not need to develop or modify code, you can use anonymous
check out from SourceForge.  An anonymous checkout permits you to
get and update a local copy of the code in CVS.  You do not need a
SourceForge account.  You can also make local changes and view the
diffs between your local code and the repository code.  You will be
unable to submit your changes.  See also the Collective CVS page.

Enter the following line command exactly as written.  When prompted for a
password, just press enter::

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective login

Once you are logged into the pserver, you can checkout (co) the Product
you need.  For the next command, you will need to replace *modulename*
with the name of the module you want to checkcout.   The *modulename* is
generally the top level folder for a Plone_ Product.  See the list of
folders in the CVS web interface for the Collective.  For example, if you
wanted a copy of PloneHelpCenter, you wouldd replace *modulename* with the
word ``PloneHelpCenter``::

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective co -P modulename


You want to do development work on a Product
--------------------------------------------

Anonymous checkout does not permit you to commit changes to a Product
in the Collective.  If you need to modify and submit code to the
Collective, you will need to get an account on SourceForge.  Once
you have that account, someone will need to add you to the list of
developers for the Plone_ Collective project on SourceForge.  You
will  be checking out code over a secure SSH tunnel.  SourceForge
provides decent documentation concerning configuration of client
software for accessing their CVS repositories over SSH.

The command to checkout code for development follows.  Remember to replace
*developername* with your name and *modulename* with the folder of code
you want.  For example, if you wanted to check out a copy of
PloneHelpCenter, you wouldd replace *modulename* with the word
``PloneHelpCenter``::

    cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective co -P modulename

If you do not need to develop or modify code, you can use anonymous
check out from SourceForge.  An anonymous checkout permits you to
get and update a local copy of the code in CVS.  You do not need a
SourceForge account.  You can also make local changes and view the
diffs between your local code and the repository code.  You will be
unable to submit your changes.  See also the Collective CVS page.

Enter the following line command exactly as written.  When prompted for a
password, just press enter::

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective login

Once you are logged into the pserver, you can checkout (co) the Product
you need.  For the next command, you will need to replace *modulename*
with the name of the module you want to checkcout.   The *modulename* is
generally the top level folder for a Plone_ Product.  See the list of
folders in the CVS web interface for the Collective.  For example, if you
wanted a copy of PloneHelpCenter, you wouldd replace *modulename* with the
word ``PloneHelpCenter``::

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective co -P modulename


You want to do development work on a Product
--------------------------------------------

Anonymous checkout does not permit you to commit changes to a Product
in the Collective.  If you need to modify and submit code to the
Collective, you will need to get an account on SourceForge.  Once
you have that account, someone will need to add you to the list of
developers for the Plone_ Collective project on SourceForge.  You
will  be checking out code over a secure SSH tunnel.  SourceForge
provides decent documentation concerning configuration of client
software for accessing their CVS repositories over SSH.

The command to checkout code for development follows.  Remember to replace
*developername* with your name and *modulename* with the folder of code
you want.  For example, if you wanted to check out a copy of
PloneHelpCenter, you wouldd replace *modulename* with the word
``PloneHelpCenter``::

    cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective co -P modulename

This howto is a document that starts in the pending state and is only

The rest of the content below this description was basically stolen from
the CVS tutorial on Plone.org just to give us a non-trivial document.
It is one of the few reStructured Text documents for which I have the
source format.

Section 1
=========

This document was spawned from conversations on the #plone IRC channel.
A new version of the PloneHelpCenter from the Plone_ Collective was
undergoing testing, but some developers wanted to start working on brand
new code.  The danger was that the new code would delay the deployment
of some of the much-needed bug fixes and changes that were almost ready
for deployment on plone.org.  The obivous choice was to create a branch,
but no one seemed comfortable enough with CVS to make a branch.  I
volunteered to make a minimal HOWTO that would explain the essential
CVS commands for getting day to day work done, up to and including
creating branches and merging code between branches.

I assume that you are familiar with revision control in general and
have CVS client software installed and working.  We just provide a
quick explanation of the most common commands that you will need.  While
there are some great CVS GUIs (Win CVS, Tortois CVS, Cervisia, etc.),
I will only cover the cvs command line here.

Please see the end of this document for links to more complete CVS
documentation and to some useful CVS tools.

General syntax
--------------

CVS command line syntax looks like this::

    cvs [global-options] command [command-options] [command-arguments]

The ``command`` is one of the CVS commands, such as checkout, update, or
commit.  To see a brief list of the available commands, use the
following option::

    cvs --help-commands

The ``global-options`` are the same for all commands.  Each command has
a different set of ``command-options`` and ``command-arguments``.

The most common ``global-options`` are listed here for later reference.

``-d``
    specifies the root of the CVS tree and possibly also identifies a
    remote repository, account name, and connection method for the
    remote repository; overrides the CVSROOT environment variable;
    generally only used with the checkout command (after that, cvs
    reads this information from the CVS/Root file in your personal
    copy of the files)
``-n``
    do not execute anything that would change the disk; for many commands,
    this options shows what would be done, but does not actually do it
``-z``
    specifies a compression level for network traffic; recommended for
    remote repositories


Section 2
=========

How to get a local copy of code for a Product from the Plone_ Collective.

The CVS command to get a local working copy of code from a central CVS
repository is ``checkout``.  This command is normally abbreviated as ``co``.
This command will give you a copy of all of the files of a directory
tree on your machine.  This local copy is sometimes called your
sandbox (you get to play in your sandbox).  A checkout works on a module,
which will just be a top-level folder in the Collective for our purposes.

with the name of the module you want to checkcout.   The *modulename* is
generally the top level folder for a Plone_ Product.  See the list of
folders in the CVS web interface for the Collective.  For example, if you
wanted a copy of PloneHelpCenter, you wouldd replace *modulename* with the
word ``PloneHelpCenter``::

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective co -P modulename


You want to do development work on a Product
--------------------------------------------

Anonymous checkout does not permit you to commit changes to a Product
in the Collective.  If you need to modify and submit code to the
Collective, you will need to get an account on SourceForge.  Once
you have that account, someone will need to add you to the list of
developers for the Plone_ Collective project on SourceForge.  You
will  be checking out code over a secure SSH tunnel.  SourceForge
provides decent documentation concerning configuration of client
software for accessing their CVS repositories over SSH.

The command to checkout code for development follows.  Remember to replace
*developername* with your name and *modulename* with the folder of code
you want.  For example, if you wanted to check out a copy of
PloneHelpCenter, you wouldd replace *modulename* with the word
``PloneHelpCenter``::

    cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective co -P modulename

=========

The rest of the content below this point was basically stolen from
the CVS tutorial on Plone.org just to give us a non-trivial document.
It is one of the few reStructured Text documents for which I have the
source format.

This document was spawned from conversations on the #plone IRC channel.
A new version of the PloneHelpCenter from the Plone Collective was
undergoing testing, but some developers wanted to start working on brand
new code.  The danger was that the new code would delay the deployment
of some of the much-needed bug fixes and changes that were almost ready
for deployment on plone.org.  The obivous choice was to create a branch,
but no one seemed comfortable enough with CVS to make a branch.  I
volunteered to make a minimal HOWTO that would explain the essential
CVS commands for getting day to day work done, up to and including
creating branches and merging code between branches.

I assume that you are familiar with revision control in general and
have CVS client software installed and working.  We just provide a
quick explanation of the most common commands that you will need.  While
there are some great CVS GUIs (Win CVS, Tortois CVS, Cervisia, etc.),
I will only cover the cvs command line here.

Please see the end of this document for links to more complete CVS
documentation and to some useful CVS tools.

General syntax
--------------

CVS command line syntax looks like this::

    cvs [global-options] command [command-options] [command-arguments]

The ``command`` is one of the CVS commands, such as checkout, update, or
commit.  To see a brief list of the available commands, use the
following option::

    cvs --help-commands

The ``global-options`` are the same for all commands.  Each command has
a different set of ``command-options`` and ``command-arguments``.

The most common ``global-options`` are listed here for later reference.

``-d``
    specifies the root of the CVS tree and possibly also identifies a
    remote repository, account name, and connection method for the
    remote repository; overrides the CVSROOT environment variable;
    generally only used with the checkout command (after that, cvs
    reads this information from the CVS/Root file in your personal
    copy of the files)
``-n``
    do not execute anything that would change the disk; for many commands,
    this options shows what would be done, but does not actually do it
``-z``
    specifies a compression level for network traffic; recommended for
    remote repositories

Initial Checkout
================

The rest of the content below this point was basically stolen from
the CVS tutorial on Plone.org just to give us a non-trivial document.
It is one of the few reStructured Text documents for which I have the
source format.

The CVS command to get a local working copy of code from a central CVS
repository is ``checkout``.  This command is normally abbreviated as ``co``.
This command will give you a copy of all of the files of a directory
tree on your machine.  This local copy is sometimes called your
sandbox (you get to play in your sandbox).  A checkout works on a module,
which will just be a top-level folder in the Collective for our purposes.


You just want the latest version of a Product
---------------------------------------------

If you do not need to develop or modify code, you can use anonymous
check out from SourceForge.  An anonymous checkout permits you to
get and update a local copy of the code in CVS.  You do not need a
SourceForge account.  You can also make local changes and view the
diffs between your local code and the repository code.  You will be
unable to submit your changes.  See also the Collective CVS page.

Enter the following line command exactly as written.  When prompted for a
password, just press enter::

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective login

Once you are logged into the pserver, you can checkout (co) the Product
you need.  For the next command, you will need to replace *modulename*
with the name of the module you want to checkcout.   The *modulename* is
generally the top level folder for a Plone Product.  See the list of
folders in the CVS web interfoce for the Collective.  For example, if you
wanted a copy of PloneHelpCenter, you would replace *modulename* with the
word ``PloneHelpCenter``::

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/collective co -P modulename

This cheatsheet used a command line interface to CVS since it is easy
to explain and consistent across multiple platforms.  While some
operations may continue to be easier from the command line, even some
of us who generally prefer the command line like to use a graphical
CVS client when browsing file histories and looking at diffs between
revisions.

http://www.wincvs.org/
    An excellent starting point for CVS and GUIs.  Links to multiple
    CVS client and visual diff GUIs for various platforms.
http://www.tortoisecvs.org/
    Recommended by multiple Plone developers who develop on Windows.
    This plugin enables CVS operations directly from Microsoft Windows
    file explorer.
http://www.kde.org/apps/cervisia/
    I generally use Cervisia when I want a CVS client other than the
    command line or Emacs PCL-CVS mode under KDE on my Linux machines.

Hey, all of this CVS stuff is fascinating, right?  If you were one
of the two people who did not just fall out of your chair laughing,
then here are some links to get you started learning more.  Until
everyone stops using CVS in favor of some other revision control
software, there will be a need for developers who have a thorough
knowledge of CVS.  (Not everyone is content to be a faker!)
