WORKFLOWS & PERMISSIONS:

- Any logged in user can add FAQ/HowTo/Tutorial/Link/ErrorRef.

- The content is not visible or searchable to anybody else than the
  Reviewers/Managers before it is Published.

- There is no 'visible state', available states are:

  - In-progress: Initial state, seen only to author/reviewers/managers.

  - Pending: In the review queue to be approved by reviewers/managers.

  - Published: Viewable to all.

  - Obsolete: Viewable only to author/reviewers/managers. This state
    has a very simple use now, but when plone.org finishes developing
    our rating/obsolescence-marking tool, this will likely be
    enhanced.

- Transitions should be pretty self-explanatory:

- User creates content object (state=in-progress)

  - User has checkmark in the add form that says "Submit for approval
    immediately" so they don't have to worry about the state menu
    (state="pending")

    This feature is not implemented yet; doing so would appear to
    either add a useful field to the schema, or hacking the base_edit
    form, neither of which is too pleasant. Instead, as a temporary
    measure, the portal_status_message returned after editing a
    non-published items reminds the editor that, unlike most
    plone.org content, this needs to be published to be visible.

  - Reviewer sees content in queue, checks content +
    sections/versions, answers the question if it's a relevant
    Question without an Answer, publishes. (state="published")

  - Ideally, every time someone adds a comment to an item, the owner
    of it gets a mail containing the comment + content URL.

  - The Obsolete state is for later, when the ratings tool can push
    something into an obsolete status if 3 or more people have marked
    the content wrong/obsolete. The Owner should then get a mail about
    it. 
    
    Mail sending is not turned on for these last two items. A good
    idea would be integrate this with Geoff Davis' excellent
    PortalNotifications, rather than doing this as one-off scripts.
    This product can send mail on a status change, and does so in a
    nice, clean way.
