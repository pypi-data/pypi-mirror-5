========================
PloneHelpCenter ToDo
========================

Derive section folders from ATCT folder. Add sections.
Ones that don't need order should be derived from large folder.
Since those will have rights, make sure rights search works.
[Mostly Done]

Finish traversal adapters and adapt TOC templates.

isOutdated support lost in eliminated PHCContent derivation.

ATContentTypes.py nextprevious.py excludes folderish items from navigation.
I need to make a derived adapter for ref manual sections.
[dbfrombrc working on this]

manual pages must be linkable in Kupu

manual view with section/page descriptions

Need templating work for all folderish types

Tests to cover new features


Setting up a test instance with Plone.Org data
----------------------------------------------

In a test buildout of Plone 3.x, add the following to eggs:

    Products.PloneHelpCenter==1.6.1
    Products.AddRemoveWidget
    Products.PloneFormGen

run buildout

Download the Plone.Org doc export from:

http://dist.plone.org/.x/documentation.zexp

Copy it into your client instance's import folder. For me that was:

cp ~/Downloads/documentation.zexp parts/client1/import/

Install a Plone site if necessary. QuickInstall AddRemoveWidgets (first),
PFG and PHC.

Import documentation.zexp -- this will take a while. You may wish to
save a copy of your Data.fs after this if you think you'll be retesting
the data migration.

If you're going to be developing, check out the PHC trunk into src. You
know the drill from here.

If just testing, change the PHC line in your buildout to

Products.PloneHelpCenter>=3.0a1

Rerun buildout.

In either case, restart Zope. Go to portal_setup in the ZMI, choose
the "Upgrades" tab and run the "Upgrading the types (0.0 â†’ 3.0)" upgrade
step. This will also take a while.

Go for it!
