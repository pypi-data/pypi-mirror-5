Upgrades
--------

If you are upgrading a Plone site with an existing help center from a
version prior to 3.0, you *must* run the upgrade profile. 

Step by step follow this order
................................

Do not upgrade from PHC 1.6.x on Plone 3.x to PHC 4.x in Plone 4.x in one step.

Update first to Plone 3.3.5+ with::

    Products.PloneHelpCenter = 1.6.2 
    Products.AddRemoveWidget = 1.4.2

Check if example content is present!
Then update buildout to::

    Products.PloneHelpCenter = 3.0b3

run::
    
    bin/buildout -v 

    * restart instance and 

    * deinstall Products.PloneHelpCenter 3.0b3

    * install Products.PloneHelpCenter 3.0b3

    * in the ZMI go to:  Generic Setup Tool at  /acsr/portal_setup  Tab "Upgrades"
    
    * after selecting: "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" and clicking "Choose Profile" you get first::
    
        Upgrades

        The profile "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" is currently upgraded to version 3.0b3.

        The filesystem version for the "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" profile is currently 3.0b3.
        
        No upgrade available.

    * Now click at -> Show old upgrades: "show" an see::
        
        Available upgrades:
        Upgrade Step Group
        -> 		Upgrading the types 	
        (0.0 â†’ 3.0)
    
    * select the item and run the upgrade
    
    * you get::
    
        Upgrades

        The profile "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" is currently upgraded to version 3.0.
        
        The filesystem version for the "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" profile is currently 3.0b3.
        
        No upgrade available.

Content should be back again!

Optional
--------

AddRemoveWidget -- PLEASE NOTE: if AddRemoveWidget is installed
as a Zope product, you *must* also install it in Plone. If it is
present without being installed, errors will occur.


Installing with buildout
------------------------

If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Plone
Help Center is very simple. You can install it by adding it to the
eggs line for your instance::

  [instance]
  eggs = Products.PloneHelpCenter


If another egg package depends on Products.PloneHelpCenter you do not need
to specify anything in the buildout configuration: buildout will detect this
automatically.

After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
will take care of updating your system.

.. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout

Installing without buildout
---------------------------

Move (or symlink) the ``PloneHelpCenter`` folder of this project
(``Products.PloneHelpCenter/Products/PloneHelpCenter``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.

You may also download a traditional tarball that you unpack into Products
from http://plone.org/products/PloneHelpCenter .
