When a new HelpCenter is created, it automatically creates one of each 
folderish type.  These container types hold the help center content.  


I want anonymous users to see the folderish types in the nav portlet.

  Publish the folderish help center types that you want to show.


I don't have Error References, and I never will.  How should I get rid
of the Error Reference portlet in the helpcenter_view.

  Under the HelpCenter, find the FAQ folderish type.  Delete it.  The 
  helpcenter_view will now no longer show the type.  


I don't want anonymous users to see the FAQ portlet in the
helpcenter_view, but I don't want to delete the FAQ folderish type
yet.

  Under the HelpCenter, find the FAQ folderish type.  Make it private.
  Of course, now no one else will be able to see the FAQs in that
  folder.
