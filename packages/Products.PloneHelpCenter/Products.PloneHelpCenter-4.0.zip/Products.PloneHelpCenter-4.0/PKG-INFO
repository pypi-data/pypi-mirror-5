Description: ========================
        Products.PloneHelpCenter
        ========================
        
        If you are upgrading an existing PHC installation, you *must* read
        INSTALL.txt.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Plone Help Center is an application designed to aid the documentation of
        Plone, and is used on plone.org to categorize and keep documentation up to
        date. It should be usable for documenting other open source products
        (such as Plone Product add-ons) or even for other documentation projects.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Plone Help Center has inline documentation, just add a help center.
        
        What's New in 3.0
        =================
        
        The underlying architecture of previous versions of PHC was basically
        Plone 2.0. It was built on Archetypes without ATContentTypes. Features
        like next/previous navigation and automatic tables of contents were all
        built in. In many way, PHC was a test center for new Plone features.
        
        However, Plone advanced and PHC did not.
        
        PHC 3 is much less ambitious. Rather than trying to add new features
        to Plone, this version seeks to inherit Plone 3 features by reimplementing
        most of the PHC content types as ATCT-derived classes that automatically
        implement Plone 3 behavior. PHC-specific features are added via sub-classing
        or interfaces/adapters.

        Upgrades
        --------
        
        If you are upgrading a Plone site with an existing help center from a
        version prior to 3.0, you *must* run the upgrade profile. 
        
        Step by step follow this order
        ................................
        
        Do not upgrade from PHC 1.6.x on Plone 3.x to PHC 4.x in Plone 4.x in one step.
        
        Update first to Plone 3.3.5+ with::
        
            Products.PloneHelpCenter = 1.6.2 
            Products.AddRemoveWidget = 1.4.2
        
        Check if example content is present!
        Then update buildout to::
        
            Products.PloneHelpCenter = 3.0b3
        
        run::
            
            bin/buildout -v 
        
            * restart instance and 
        
            * deinstall Products.PloneHelpCenter 3.0b3
        
            * install Products.PloneHelpCenter 3.0b3
        
            * in the ZMI go to:  Generic Setup Tool at  /acsr/portal_setup  Tab "Upgrades"
            
            * after selecting: "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" and clicking "Choose Profile" you get first::
            
                Upgrades
        
                The profile "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" is currently upgraded to version 3.0b3.
        
                The filesystem version for the "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" profile is currently 3.0b3.
                
                No upgrade available.
        
            * Now click at -> Show old upgrades: "show" an see::
                
                Available upgrades:
                Upgrade Step Group
                -> 		Upgrading the types 	
                (0.0 → 3.0)
            
            * select the item and run the upgrade
            
            * you get::
            
                Upgrades
        
                The profile "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" is currently upgraded to version 3.0.
                
                The filesystem version for the "Products.PloneHelpCenter:default" profile is currently 3.0b3.
                
                No upgrade available.
        
        Content should be back again!
        
        Optional
        --------
        
        AddRemoveWidget -- PLEASE NOTE: if AddRemoveWidget is installed
        as a Zope product, you *must* also install it in Plone. If it is
        present without being installed, errors will occur.
        
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Plone
        Help Center is very simple. You can install it by adding it to the
        eggs line for your instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs = Products.PloneHelpCenter
        
        
        If another egg package depends on Products.PloneHelpCenter you do not need
        to specify anything in the buildout configuration: buildout will detect this
        automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Move (or symlink) the ``PloneHelpCenter`` folder of this project
        (``Products.PloneHelpCenter/Products/PloneHelpCenter``) into the ``Products`` directory of
        the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.
        
        You may also download a traditional tarball that you unpack into Products
        from http://plone.org/products/PloneHelpCenter .
        
        HISTORY
        =======
        
        4.0 (2013-09-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Compatible with Plone 4.2 and 4.3.  Should still work on 4.0 and
          4.1.
          [maurits]
        
        - Types: switch from content_icon to icon_expr.
          [maurits]
        
        - Switch the sample manual text to html.  This way you can edit it
          properly with TinyMCE.  It used to be structured text, which is
          not accepted as mimetext by default, so you would actually lose
          the layout when you edit it.
          [maurits]
        
        - Register png icons from standard Plone for HelpCenterHowToFolder
          and HelpCenterLinkFolder.  Add upgrade step to apply the
          typeinfo and recatalog these two portal_types.  Otherwise on
          Plone 4.3 these items miss icons in listings.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed faqfolder_view error by checking if item brain returns a value 
          when asking for getSections
          [ichim-david]
        
        - Removed ancient patch for CMFCore 1.4.7 or lower, which was last
          used in Plone 2.0.5.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix test for knowledge base type not globally addable.
          [ale-rt]
        
        - Replace rss.gif with rss.png
          [ale-rt]
        
        - Removed unused to remove dependency from zope.app.publisher.
          [ale-rt]
        
        - Make ManualPage addable through tempfolder
          [tiberiuichim]
        
        - Make the knowledge base type not globally addable.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Make it possible to filter phc_search by getVersions
          [davisagli @ cioppino]
        
        - Improved styling of portlet_phc_about
          [davisagli, hennaheto @ cioppino]

        - Revamp helpcenter_topicview_main to show start-here items,
          topic counts.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Add getPHCSubNav method for PloneHelpCenter to create subnavigation.
          [stevem]
        
        - Added metadata.xml file, used by QuickInstaller when upgrading
          [afd]

          [miohtama]
        
        - Use the containment acquisition chain to get the parent
          attributes in ReferenceManualSection type.
          [dukebody]

        - Use ordering adapters in Plone 4 to sort items in sections.
          [dukebody]
        
        - Make the default view for PHC folders obey the items ordering
          set using the Contents tab. Formerly, they were sorted
          alphabetically by title.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter/issues/121.
          [dukebody]

          Fixes http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter/issues/118.
          [dukebody]

          duplicating the Metadata schemata already present in the edit
          view in Plone 3.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter/issues/119.
          [dukebody]
        
        - Make mail sending code compatible with Plone 3. PHC 4 is now
          compatible with both Plone 3 and 4.
          [dukebody]
        
        
        PloneHelpCenter 4.0a1 (2010-12-07)
        ----------------------------------
        
        - Use lxml to turn image relative links into absolute for the
          one-page version of manuals. This introduces a new install
          dependency on lxml.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter/issues/136.
          [dukebody]

          AttributeErrors when not using an acquisition wrapper (newer
          Zope versions).
          [dukebody]
        
        - Fix next/previous custom adapter to visit the same items as appear in
          the navigation dropdown. Also make sure this adapter is used for legacy
          ReferenceManuals. This fixes
          http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter/issues/152/.
          [dukebody, davisagli]
