HISTORY
=======

4.0 (2013-09-21)
----------------

- Compatible with Plone 4.2 and 4.3.  Should still work on 4.0 and
  4.1.
  [maurits]

- Types: switch from content_icon to icon_expr.
  [maurits]

- Switch the sample manual text to html.  This way you can edit it
  properly with TinyMCE.  It used to be structured text, which is
  not accepted as mimetext by default, so you would actually lose
  the layout when you edit it.
  [maurits]

- Register png icons from standard Plone for HelpCenterHowToFolder
  and HelpCenterLinkFolder.  Add upgrade step to apply the
  typeinfo and recatalog these two portal_types.  Otherwise on

PloneHelpCenter 4.0a1 (2010-12-07)
