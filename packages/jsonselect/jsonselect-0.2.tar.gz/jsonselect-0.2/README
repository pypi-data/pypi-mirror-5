#jsonselect.py

jsonselect.py is a python implementation of https://github.com/fd/json_select

You can find more information here http://jsonselect.org/


## Usage

jsonselect can be called directly from the command line.

`python -m jsonselect <selector> < jsonfile`

This is usefull, for example, for parsing out values from JSON APIs.

```sh
$aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=kafka" | python -m jsonselect .InstanceId
["i-12345678", "i-23456789", "i-3456789A"]
```


## Project status

jsonselect.py currently implements levels 1 & 2 of these conformance tests https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelectTests

level 3 is unimplemented because I was having trouble understanding what the correct behavior should be


##Tests

get the upstream conformance tests:
git submodule update --init

Run specific level conformance tests with
nosetests -m '.*_level_1' ./tests/test_conformance.py
