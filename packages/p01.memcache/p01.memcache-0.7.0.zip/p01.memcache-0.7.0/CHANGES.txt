Changes

0.7.0 (2013-07-18)
------------------

- bring back the old plain python memcached client implementation in client.py
  and move all ultra memcached client components to uclient.py. The plain
  python memcached client concept does not work well with pooling.


0.6.0 (2013-07-03)
------------------

- feature: implemented memcache client connection pool

- feature: implemented ultramemcache support with uclient.UltraMemcacheClient.
  You must now define python-memcached or umemcache as egg dependency in your
  project since we don't know which one you need.

- feature: move subscriber to it's own configure zcml and include by default
  for BBB


0.5.0 (2012-12-09)
------------------

- initial release
