Description: A library of convenience functions for wxPython.  The aim
        here is to simplify code, reduce boiler-plate, and prevent repeating code
        across several projects.
        
        These are primarily simplified widgets with common attributes, such as
              b = button(parent, label, action=action, **kws)
        
        which attaches a callback to a wx.Button, corresponding to
              b = wx.Button(parent, label=label, **kws)
              if hasattr(action, '__call__'):
                  parent.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, action, b)
        
        Yes, this is merely a convenience, but covers a remarkably common pattern.
        There are several similar widgets.  In addition, there are more complex
        widgets, such as:
             FloatCtrl  wx.TextCrtl, allowing numerical input only. Precision,
                        upper bound, and lower bound can be set, and a callback
                        can be bound to the control.
             NumericCombo  wx.ComboBox with a FloatCtrl
             YesNo      a wx.Choice of only 'No' and 'Yes'
