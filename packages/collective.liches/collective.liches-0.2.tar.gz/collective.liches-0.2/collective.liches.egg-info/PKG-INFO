        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Add ``collective.liches`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =

        Re-run buildout, e.g. with
        
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        Restart Plone and activate the product in Plones Add-on configuration
        section.
        
        
        Usage
        ======
        
        Configure the access to your Liches_ Linkchecker server and which content
        types will be displayed on your link checker start page in the plone
        control panel. The 'Secrect Key' is you Liches_ API Key and used to
        update existing pages in the Liches server
        
        .. image:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liches/master/docs/liches-settings.png
        
        
        Linkcheckers normally go through your site recursivly which
        will result in many pages to be checked several times. The
        linkchecker start pages tries to avoid this by giving the
        linkchecker_ a page from which every relevant content item can be reached.
        Append `@@linkchecker-startpage.html` to your siteroot to view this page.
        
        .. image:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liches/master/docs/linkchecker-startpage.png
        
        The Liches portlet gives an overview how many pages with broken links
        are present in the site or the current path.
        
        .. image:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liches/master/docs/liches-portlet.png
        
        The links in the portlet take you to a page which gives you an overview
        of the pages with broken links in the site or current path. Alternatively
        append `@@linkchecker-brokenpages.html` to your site root or to any
        folder(ish object) in your site.
        
        .. image:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liches/master/docs/broken-pages-in-site.png
        
        All pages will show you (as long as you are able to edit it) which links
        are broken. At the top you see a summary of the links and the result
        of the linkcheck. Broken Links are highlighted and underlined in red.
        After you corrected the links you may want to recheck the links in this
        page. Press the 'Check Links' Button and wait for a few minutes for the
        linkchecker_ to finish.

        You may also want to have a look at the competition.
        
        gocept.linkchecker_  relies on a separate process gocept.lms_ to perform
        external link-checking. It communicates with Plone via XML-RPC.
        
        collective.linkcheck_ is an integrated solution, with a headless instance
        processing items in the background.
        
        Why yet another solution?
        -------------------------
        
        - I want my linkchecking to be independent from plone and to be
          able to monitor non plone sites with the same tool.
        - Linkchecking is hard. The venerable linkchecker_ is a tried and tested
          tool that does this job good. It has lots of options to finetune the results
          to your needs e.g. to check the validity of HTLM and CSS.
