        Usage
        -----
        
            # Import and open up a ne "file"
            from redisfile import RedisFile
            f = RedisFile("myrediskey")
            # Write some lines to the "file"
            f.write('hello')
            f.writelines('world')
            f.writelines('Your
        Awesome')
            # Read the whole file
            print f.read()
            # Reading a file from the end shows no data
            print f.read()
            # seek to the start of the file
            f.seek(0)
            # Read a single line
            print f.readline()
            # Read the rest
            print f.read()
            # "close" will delete all the data
            f.close()
