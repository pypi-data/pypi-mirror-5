Description: About 'pyojo' app development
        ----------------------------- 
        
        This is yet another framework to help develop web applicattions 
        with python. The difference is that it is oriented to create 
        applications with The Dojo Toolkit, trying to facilitate a set
        of wrappers to generate the javascript sent to the client and 
        providing help to work with the AMD loader. 
        
        Pyojo provides decorators to set up the route map and assign
        some functions or classes to certain URLs, but it also can be 
        used creating python modules in a folder structure, where the
        name of the module defines the content type, and the returned
        value of a function named GET, POST, PUT or DELETE is the
        response.
        
        The minimal "Hello World":
        
            import pyojo
            from pyojo import server
        
            @pyojo.route("/")
            def Home():
                return "Hello World!"
        
            server.main()
        
        
        A basic example with javascript:
        
            import pyojo
        
            #Redirect to index.html
            @pyojo.route("/")
            def Home(request):
               return request.static("index.html")
        
        And then a couple of modules at ./srv (the default folder) will
        handle this request:
        
        srv/index_html.py:
        
            def GET(request):
        	   return '''<html>
                           <body><script src='main.js'></body>
                          </html>'''
                
        srv/main_js.py:
        
            def GET(request):
        	   return "alert('Hello World!');"
        
        But the real power is in the pyojo.js modules, offering a set 
        of code generation utilities for your Dojo application.
