Description: The Owl Embedded Python System is a free and open-source system for programming small 32-bit microcontrollers in Python. It is dramatically easier to use than other programming environments for microcontrollers, while still powerful enough to build just about anything. Try it out today!
        
        Owl is currently in a limited release. Right now, we have released VM binaries for TI Stellaris microcontrollers and the user toolchain as well as the complete source code. This is enough to get started programming microcontrollers, though there are more pieces yet to be released.
        
        You can find the Owl documentation, binaries and toolchains on our website at http://embeddedpython.org/. If you have any questions about Owl, contact me at twb@embeddedpython.org or twb@rice.edu.
