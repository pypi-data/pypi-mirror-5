Description: About
        =====
        
        This script comes in support of the submitted paper:
        
        *Low-bandwidth and non-compute intensive remote
        identification of microbes from raw sequencing reads*.
        
        - It requires:
        
            - Python 3.3 (note the ".3")
        
            - bowtie2 (parameter "-a", try "--help")
        
        - It is self-documented (try "-h" or "--help").
        
        - It is working on FASTQ or gzipped-FASTQ files, possibly on BAM files
        
        Be gentle and please do not hammer the server like there is no tomorrow.
        
        The latest released versions of the package will always be on Pypi.
        
        Usage
