Django-rauthall - Installation instructions
=============================================

Creating an enviroment for your project
---------------------------------------

You have to create an environment where everything will be installed.
Create first the directory where the environment will be created and
enter in the enviroment:

::
	$ mkdir myproject
	$ cd myproject
	$ virtualenv --distribute env
	$ source env/bin/activate


Creating a new django project
-----------------------------

Once you're into the enviroment, next step involves creating a new
django project. So, being inside the virtual environment, we must
install django (required dependency, of course) and then, create the project:

::

	$ pip install django


Installing Django-rflatpages
-----------------------------

Now we have a real project, we're ready to import Django-rauthall, so
we can handle it managing the following pip command:

::

    $ pip install django-rauthall
