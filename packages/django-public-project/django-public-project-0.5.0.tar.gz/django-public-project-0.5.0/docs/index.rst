django-public-project - Documentation
=========================================

Django Public Project (DPP) is a specialised **content management system** written in ``Python/Django`` 
**for building an information website  around big projects**. It is open source (BSD licence) and can be used by civic groups 
to monitor the progress of publicly funded projects but also from within governmental institutions
itself to bring transparency in the proceeding of a project, inform the interested public about
what is going on and thus enhance the acceptance of the project by the different stakeholders.
