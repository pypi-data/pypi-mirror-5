* DONE Support all the file types supported by MEJS
  H.264 is the only one, and it is done by extension, not content
  type.
** mejs.plugins has a list of types supported by the plugins
** mejs.HtmlMediaElementShim.getTypeFromFile has a list of extensions
* DONE Set size of Flash player from video metadata
* TODO Don't autostart playing by default
* TODO Use MIME types instead of extensions
  Right now there is a somewhat convoluted design to be able to get
  the filename?

  Using /etc/mime.types this could be translated into MIME types.
* CANCEL Use only content-core for Plone 4

  - Note taken on [2013-05-16 Thu 11:46] \\
    Done by toutpt. Also, no Plone 3 support ATM.
  :END:
  For this we either need to either:

  - split the support for P3 and P4 into two
    separate templates;
  - add a P4-specific section into the template and guard their
    activation with conditionals.
* TODO Rename the Dexterity template to file-dexterity.pt
  For now this name will be easier to spot what the template is for.
* TODO file-at-p3/file-at-p4/file-dexterity
* DONE Don't ship with jQuery
  jQuery 1.7 is included in the browser resources of the add-on when
  it could and should be externalized to collective.js.jquery or some
  such.

  Alternatively, the MEJS repository could be included as a git
  module or sub-tree.
* TODO Use the non-minimized version of the resources
  By using the minimized versions it is harder to debug.
* TODO Preview image support
  collective.transcode.star does this already...
* TODO Actually do something in the Dexterity template
  It is more of a "Hello Dexterity" kind of template right now.
* TODO Are the custom interfaces really needed?
  So far, the IVideo interface doesn't do anything beyond just being
  there.

  There is an adapter, but would this adapter be better served by
  using the File API directly? Maybe it is there to provide a uniform
  interface for both Dexterity and AT types, but the Dex types have
  their own template anyways...
* DONE Use line breaks in documentation
  The README is written with unbroken lines, making very hard to read
  the changelog.
* TODO Ensure Silverlight is used with WMV media
