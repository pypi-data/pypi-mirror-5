    The sitemaps.org specification says that <lastmod> values
    must comply with the W3C Datetime format 
    (http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). This is a restricted
    subset of ISO8601. In particular, all forms that include a 
    time must include a timezone indication so there is no
    notion of local time (which would be tricky on the web). The
    forms allowed are:

        Year:
          YYYY (eg 1997)
        Year and month:
          YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)

          YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
        Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction 
        of a second

        where:
          TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)

    We do not anticipate the YYYY and YYYY-MM forms being used but
    interpret them as YYYY-01-01 and YYYY-MM-01 respectively. All
    dates are interpreted as having time 00:00:00.0 UTC.

    Datetimes not specified to the level of seconds are intepreted
