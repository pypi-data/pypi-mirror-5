.SH NOTES
.PP
If the task seems to be hanging, first verify remote host is in \fCknown_hosts\fR. SSH will prompt user to authorize the first contact with a remote host. One solution is to add \fCStrictHostKeyChecking no\fR in \fC.ssh/config\fR which will accept and authorize the connection on behalf of the user. However, if you run as a different user such as setting sudo to True), for example, root will not look at the user .ssh/config setting.
