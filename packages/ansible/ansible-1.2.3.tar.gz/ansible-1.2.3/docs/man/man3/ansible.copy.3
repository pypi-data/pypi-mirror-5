.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: no)(Added in Ansible version 0.7.)
   
.IP content
When used instead of 'src', sets the contents of a file directly to the specified value.(Added in Ansible version 1.1.)
   
.IP dest
Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to.(required)   
.IP force
the default is \fCyes\fR, which will replace the remote file when contents are different than the source.  If \fCno\fR, the file will only be transferred if the destination does not exist.
