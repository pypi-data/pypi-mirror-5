# requirements.pip
# ================
#
# These are the 3rd-party dependencies.  This file is intended to be passed to
# pip as a standard requirements file.
#
# To keep things as DRY as possible, this file also gets parsed by setup.py to
# come up with the value for the ``install_requires`` argument to setup().
#
# This project uses setuptools (as opposed to plain ol' distutils) because it
# provides an authentication plugin for python-novaclient, which in turn uses
# setuptools' entry point mechanism to support extensions.  In order to
# activate the plugin from a source code checkout that you intend to hack on,
# you must run ``python setup.py develop``.

# TODO: remove these once upstream gets their act together
# The following packages are python-reddwarfclient dependencies, but upstream
# messed up their packaging and the tarball in pypi does *not* refer to these:
httplib2>=0.7.7
lxml>=3.0.1
# Even though python-reddwarfclient lists the following, it doesn't actually
# use them.  And if we list them here, at least prettytable will cause a
# conflict with python-novaclient's required versions.
