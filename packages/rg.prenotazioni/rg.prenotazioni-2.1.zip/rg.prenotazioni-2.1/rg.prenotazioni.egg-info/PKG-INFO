        The product comes with its own workflow "prenotazioni_workflow".
        
        | Since versione **2.1** a new states has been added.
        | Here below a list of all the states available:
        
        **Private**: booking object initial state:
        
        * `submit` (Automatic transition to pending) 
        
        **Pending** 
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `publish` (to published)
        * `refuse` (to refused)
        
        **Published** 
        
        Transaction available:
         
        * `refuse` (to refused)
        
        **Refused** 
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `restore` (to pending)
        
        Managers can confirm a Booking using workflow transitions. 
        The workflow transition triggers an email to be sent to the booker (see below).
        
        
        Content Rules (mail notifications)
        ----------------------------------
        
        There are additional content rules that can be used to notify booking owner when his booking has been accepted
        or re-scheduled.
        
        Rules are automatically created and enabled. See the Rule control panel to change settings.
        
        There's also a rule that can warn the Booking Folder responsible when new booking are created, but you need to
        manually enable it on folders.
