Installation & Configuration
----------------------------
You can install the latest release of ``armstrong.hatband`` using `pip`_:

::

    pip install armstrong.hatband

Make sure to add ``armstrong.hatband`` and ``django.contrib.admin`` to your
``INSTALLED_APPS``.  You can add this however you like.  This works as a
copy-and-paste solution:

::

	INSTALLED_APPS += ["armstrong.hatband", "django.contrib.admin", ]

Once installed, you must run ``syncdb`` in order to install Django's admin
models.  This is only required if you did not have Django's admin already
installed and configured.

Finally, you must alter your URL configuration.  At the top of your ``urls``
module (``urls.defaults`` in an Armstrong project), make sure to change this
line:

::

    from django.contrib import admin

To:

::

    from armstrong import hatband as admin

The rest of the URL configuration stays identical to what is expected for the
traditional Django admin.
