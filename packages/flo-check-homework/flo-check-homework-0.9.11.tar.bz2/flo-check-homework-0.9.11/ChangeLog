	Release 0.9.11

2013-08-29  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Working i18n with French translation

	* The default language (under the "C" locale) is English. If the locale
	is properly set up, it is used to determine the interface language.

	* Currently, the only available translation is in French. There is also
	French-specific code (that depends on French grammar) in
	exercise_generator.py that is only available when running
	flo-check-homework under a French locale.

	Rewrite all translatable strings in English

	* This is the first part of proper i18n.

2013-08-22  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.10.

	* setup.cfg: remove the "prefix=/usr/local" setting that breaks
	installations with pip in a virtualenv (at least).

	* setup.cfg: don't build zip source distributions anymore (to save
	space...).

	* setup.py: simplify as much as possible, which implies that the
	source distribution now ships README.rst instead of README.xhtml.

2013-06-23  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.9.

	* flo_check_homework/conjugations/fr_FR.py: fix a spelling error
	in a conjugation of "venir".

2013-04-01  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.8.

	* flo_check_homework/main.py: fix wrong value of score_threshold
	due to a mistake in the previous change.

2013-03-25  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.7.

	* flo_check_homework/main.py: adjust score_threshold to use the
	same value that triggers the transition between images from
	20-not_good_enough to 30-happy in order to avoid confusion
	(getting an image from 20-not_good_enough while still being able
	to run the desired program is certainly confusing).
	* flo_check_homework/main.py: use float("-inf") as the lowest
	threshold in reward_images, although it should not change anything
	for now, as the score cannot be negative with the current defaults
	set in the various question generators.

2013-03-14  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Initial release (0.9.6).
