        ========
        
        A simple framework for distributed task workflow using redis. Designed
        to be easily extensible with code, rather than excessively featureful
        out of the box.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Tasa requires a version of Python 2.7. If you're using an older
        version, now is an excellent time to upgrade. If you're running Python
        3, compatibility patches are welcome.
        
        Make sure you have redis and the python redis bindings installed. If
        you're using a remote redis instance, you can set the `REDIS_ADDRESS`
        environment variable.
