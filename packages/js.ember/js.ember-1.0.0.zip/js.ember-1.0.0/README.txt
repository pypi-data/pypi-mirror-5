Introduction
============

This library packages `ember.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original ember.js is published to some URL.

.. WARNING::
   Ember data is still a beta release!
