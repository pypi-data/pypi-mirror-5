        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `ember.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`ember.js`: http://emberjs.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original ember.js is published to some URL.
        
        .. WARNING::
           Ember data is still a beta release!
