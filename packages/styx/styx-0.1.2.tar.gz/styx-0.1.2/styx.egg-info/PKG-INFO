Description: styx: A simple distributed message queue based on Redis
        =======================================================
        
        Styx is a simple library that turns a bunch of standalone `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_ servers into a powerful distributed queue.
        The redis servers don't need any special configuration or even be aware of each other in any way. The messages are loosely ordered.
        A java version can be found `here <https://github.com/abh1nav/styx/>`_. The java and python versions are compatible - i.e. messages
        published by one client can be read by the other client.
        
        Install
        -------
        .. code-block:: python
        
            pip install styx
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            # encoding: utf-8
        
            import styx
        
            # Define the Redis host locations (the default port is 6379)
            hosts = [ "redis1.example.com", "redis2.example.com:8080", "redis3.example.com" ]
        
            connection = styx.Styx(hosts, db=3) # default db is 0
            # If a queue doesn't exist, it will be created automatically
            q = connection.get_queue("myTestQueue")
            q.put("Hello")
            q.put("World")
            q.put("Message1234")
        
            q.get() # returns "Hello"
            q.get() # returns "World"
        
            # Check how many messages are left in the queue
            q.size() # returns 1
        
            # Delete this queue
            connection.delete_queue(q)
