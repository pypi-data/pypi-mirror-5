============

(Does not use raptus.easyslider because jquerytools is shipped with Plone)

The reason for this being not integrated in `raptus.article.slider` is that
the latter depends on `raptus.article.nesting`.

The following features for `raptus.article` are provided by this package:

----------

* Image Slider (Slider of images contained in the article) (XXX TODO)
* Image Slider Teaser (Slider of images contained in the article displayed above the columns)
