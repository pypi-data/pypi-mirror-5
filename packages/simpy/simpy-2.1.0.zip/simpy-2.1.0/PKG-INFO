Description: 
        SimPy 2.1.0 is a major re-release of SimPy 2.0. It repairs
        a number of errors in SimPy 2.0.1 libraries, models and documentation.
        There has been significant code refactoring in Simulation.py,
        SimulationStep.py, SimulationTrace.py, SimulationRT.py, and Lib.py.
        This resulted in a significant reduction of code to be maintained.
        
        Documentation/tutorials on using the advanced OO API have been added.
        
        SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation language
        based on standard Python and released under the GNU LGPL.
        
        It provides the modeller with components of a simulation
        model. These include processes, for active components like
        customers, messages, and vehicles, and resources, for
        passive components that form limited capacity congestion
        points like servers, checkout counters, and tunnels. It
        also provides monitor variables to aid in gathering
        statistics. SimPy comes with extensive plotting capabilities.
        
        The distribution contains in-depth documentation, tutorials,
        and a large number of simulation models.
        
        Simulation model developers are encouraged to share their
        SimPy modeling techniques with the SimPy community. Please
        post a message to the simpy-Users mailing list,
        
        mailto:simpy-users at lists.sourceforge.net.

        Software developers are also encouraged to interface SimPy with
        other Python-accessible packages, such as GUI, data base or
        mapping and to share these new capabilities with the
        community under the GNU LGPL.
