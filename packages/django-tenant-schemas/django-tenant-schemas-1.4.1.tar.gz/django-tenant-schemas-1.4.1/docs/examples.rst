Tenant Tutorial
-----------------
This app comes with an interactive tutorial to teach you how to use it and to demonstrate its capabilities. This example project is available under `examples/tenant_tutorial <https://github.com/bcarneiro/django-tenant-schemas/blob/master/examples/tenant_tutorial>`. You will only need to edit the `settings.py` file to configure the `DATABASES` variable and then you're ready to run `./manage.py runserver`. All other steps will be explained live.
