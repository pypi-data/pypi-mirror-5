Description: 
        A context manager that creates savepoints, avoiding recalculting expensive
        parts of the code.
        
        An example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from savepoint import SavePoint
        
            a = 10
            b = 20
        
            # do some expensive calculation here
            with SavePoint("stuff.p"):
                print "doing stuff"
                a += 10
                c = 30
        
            print a, b, c
        
        The first time the code is ran the `with` block is executed, and the modifed 
        scope is pickled to `stuff.p`. Subsequent calls will update the global scope
        from the pickle file, and skip the block completely.
