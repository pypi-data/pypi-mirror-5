===================
Propeller Framework
===================

Propeller is a lightweight, open source HTTP framework written in Python and
focuses on quickly writing web apps with minimal effort. Propeller relies on
Jinja2 for templating. It's pretty fast, too. Propeller is BSD-licensed.

Propeller doesn't get in your way. It provides a fast, lightweight framework
that handles the low level stuff, but doesn't impose object-relational
mappers, form validation, MVC patterns or the like. That's all up to you.
