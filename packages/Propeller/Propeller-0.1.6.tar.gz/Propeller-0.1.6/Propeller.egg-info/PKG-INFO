Description: ===================
        Propeller Framework
        ===================
        
        Propeller is a lightweight, open source HTTP framework written in Python and
        focuses on quickly writing web apps with minimal effort. Propeller relies on
        Jinja2 for templating. It's pretty fast, too. Propeller is BSD-licensed.
        
        Propeller doesn't get in your way. It provides a fast, lightweight framework
        that handles the low level stuff, but doesn't impose object-relational
        mappers, form validation, MVC patterns or the like. That's all up to you.
