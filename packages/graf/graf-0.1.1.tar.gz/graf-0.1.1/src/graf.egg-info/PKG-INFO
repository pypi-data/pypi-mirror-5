Description: # Graf
        
        Graf was built as a daily graph drawing program.
        There is a powerfull graph drawing tool called [matplotlib][] but that is too
        powerfull and complecated to use as a daily tool.
        The purpose of the Graf is to make it easier and simpler for daily graph drawing
        powerd by wrapping matplotlib and giving some useful methods for loading or
        analysing data.
        
        # Example
        Prepare example data in `raw` directory as `data.00.txt`, `data.01.txt`, ...etc.
        Save the following code as `example01.graf` and run `graf example01.graf`
        
        ```python
        # Load column 0 and 1 of data.00.txt, data.01.txt, ... in raw directory
        dataset = load('raw/data.??.txt', using=(0, 1))
        # Plot all data
        for x, y in dataset:
            plot(x, y)
        # Show
        show()
        ```
