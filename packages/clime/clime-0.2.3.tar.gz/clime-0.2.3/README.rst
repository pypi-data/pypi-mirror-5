Clime
=====

Clime lets you convert *any* module into a multi-command CLI program *without*
any configuration.

The main features:

1. It works well with *zero* configuration. Free you from the configuration
   hell.
2. Docstring *is* just config. When you finish the docstring, the config of the
   aliases and metavars are also finished.
3. It generates the usage of each command from the functions automatically.

It is a better choice than the heavy `optparse` or `argparse` for most of the
CLI tasks.

CLI-ize ME!
-----------

Let me show you Clime with an example.

Here we have a simple script with a docstring here: ::

    # file: repeat.py

    def repeat(message, times=2, count=False):
        '''It repeats the message.

        options:
            -m=<str>, --message=<str>  The description of this option.
            -t=<int>, --times=<int>
            -c, --count
        '''

        s = message * times
        return len(s) if count else s

After adding this line, ::

    import clime.now

... your CLI program is ready! ::
    
    $ python repeat.py twice
    twicetwice

    $ python repeat.py --times=3 thrice
    thricethricethrice

And it generates the usage manual: ::

    $ python repeat.py --help
    usage: [-t<int> | --times=<int>] [-c | --count] <message>
       or: repeat [-t<int> | --times=<int>] [-c | --count] <message>

If you have a docstring in your function, it also show up in usage manual with
``--help``. ::

    $ python repeat.py repeat --help
    usage: [-t<int> | --times=<int>] [-c | --count] <message>
       or: repeat [-t<int> | --times=<int>] [-c | --count] <message>

    It repeat the message.

    options:
        -m=<str>, --message=<str>  The message.
        -t=<int>, --times=<int>
        -c, --count
    
You can find more examples in the `clime/examples`_.

This page, `Command.parse
<http://clime.mosky.tw/api.html#clime.core.Command.parse>`_, describes how Clime
parses the arguments.

If you are interesting in the aliases or the metavariables which Clime provides,
read `Command <http://clime.mosky.tw/api.html#clime.core.Command>`_ for more
infomation.

   Install Clime from PyPI_ for a stable version ::
   
     $ sudo pip install clime
     
   If you don't have `pip`, execute ::
   
     $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
     
   to install `pip` on Debian-base Linux distribution.

    http://github.com/moskytw/clime

.. _PyPI:
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/clime

Usage
-----

You have two different ways to use Clime.

1. **Insert A Line into Your Source Code**
   
   Just add this line into your source code::
   
     import clime.now
   
   It is recommended to put the line in the ``if __name__ == '__main__':``
   block.

2. **Use Clime as A Command**
   
   `clime` is also an executable module. You can use it to convert a module or a
   stand-alone program temporarily. ::
   
     $ python -m clime TARGET

If you want to know how to customize the program, read `Program
<http://clime.mosky.tw/api.html#clime.core.Program>`_ for more infomation.
