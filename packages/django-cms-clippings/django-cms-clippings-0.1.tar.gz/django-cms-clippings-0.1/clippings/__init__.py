"""Clippings is a lightweight placeholder container for Django-CMS.

Clippings have a single placeholder, named content, which can be used to
display the content generated by one or more plugins. They are designed for
small sections of content, e.g. notes, notices or asides but there are no
restrictions on the size of the content displayed.

It allows external apps to display content that can be edited from the Django
admin (it does not support editing in place on a page). A Clipping can display
content from one or more plugins
