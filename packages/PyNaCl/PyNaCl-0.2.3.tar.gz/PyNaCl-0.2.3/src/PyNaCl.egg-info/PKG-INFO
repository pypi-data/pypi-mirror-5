        Installation
        ------------
        
        PyNaCl relies on libsodium_, a portable C library which can be compiled
        on a variety of systems. It may already be available from your package
        manager.
        
        .. _libsodium: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
        
        Once libsodium is installed, PyNaCl can be installed by:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python setup.py install
