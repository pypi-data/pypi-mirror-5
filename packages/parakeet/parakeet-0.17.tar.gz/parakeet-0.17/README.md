Parakeet
====

Parakeet is a runtime accelerator for an array-oriented subset of Python. 
If you're doing a lot of number crunching in Python, 
Parakeet may be able to significantly speed up your code. 


To accelerate a function, wrap it with Parakeet's **@jit** decorator:

```python 

import numpy as np 
from parakeet import jit 

x = np.array([1,2,3])
y = np.tanh(x * alpha) + beta
   
@jit
def fast(x, alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.3):
  return np.tanh(x * alpha) + beta 
   
@jit 
def loopy(x, alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.3):
  y = np.empty_like(x)
  for i in xrange(len(x)):
    y[i] = np.tanh(x[i] * alpha) + beta
  return y
     
  
@jit
def comprehension(x, alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.3):
  return np.array([np.tanh(xi*alpha) + beta for xi in x])
  

assert np.allclose(fast(x), y)
assert np.allclose(loopy(x), y)
assert np.allclose(comprehension(x), y)

```



Install
====
You should be able to install Parakeet from its [PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parakeet/) by running:

    pip install parakeet


Dependencies
====

Parakeet is written for Python 2.7 (sorry internet) and depends on:

* [treelike](https://github.com/iskandr/treelike)
* [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for unit tests
* [NumPy and SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/install.html)

Optional (if using the LLVM backend):

* [llvmpy](http://www.llvmpy.org/#quickstart)




Supported language features
====

Parakeet cannot accelerate arbitrary Python code, it only supports a limited subset of the language:

  * Scalar operations (i.e. addition, multiplication, etc...)
  * Control flow (if-statements, loops, etc...)
  * Tuples
  * Slices
  * NumPy arrays (and some NumPy library functions) 
  * List literals (interpreted as array construction)
  * List comprehensions (interpreted as array comprehensions)
  * Parakeet's "adverbs" (higher order array operations like parakeet.map, parakeet.reduce)

How does it work? 
====
Your untyped function gets used as a template from which multiple *type specializations* are generated 
(for each distinct set of input types). 
These typed functions are then churned through many optimizations before finally getting translated into native code. 
For more information about the project you can watch the [Parakeet presentation](https://vimeo.com/73895275) from 
this year's [PyData Boston](http://pydata.org/bos2013), look at the [HotPar slides](https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotpar12/parakeet-just-time-parallel-accelerator-python) from last year or contact the [Alex Rubinsteyn](http://www.rubinsteyn.com).

Backends
===
Parakeet currently supports compilation to C or LLVM. To switch between these options change `parakeet.config.default_backend` to either "c" or "llvm".
