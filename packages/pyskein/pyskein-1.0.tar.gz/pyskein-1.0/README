PySkein 1.0
===========

This file only covers some basic installation instructions. For any further
information please consult the docs, starting with "doc/index.html".


Installation
------------

Notes:
    * You need Python 3.1 or later to run PySkein!

    * If you have a version of PySkein <0.5 installed, please make sure to
      manually delete "skein.*" from your Python site-packages directory before
      installing a more recent version!

    * Earlier versions of PySkein may implement different versions of the
      Skein algorithm and so produce different hash outputs.
      Check doc/download.html for an overview of which version of PySkein
      corresponds to which version of the Skein specification.

To build and install globally run (with appropriate permissions):

$ python3 setup.py install

To install locally into your home directory run:

$ python3 setup.py install --user

The setup script will also install the two demo scripts "skeinsum" and
"threefish" into a corresponding location.
