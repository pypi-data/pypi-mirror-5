Pipimport automatically installs missing modules using pip at import time.
It is best used with virtualenv.

Just import pipimport and call install():

>>> import pipimport
>>> pipimport.install()

Now you can normally import modules that are not currently installed.
Pipimport will call pip (form your virtualenv) and install it before importing.

>>> import unipath
Will install module unipath
