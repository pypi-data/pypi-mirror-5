collective.xmpp.chat Installation
---------------------------------

If you are using zc.buildout and plone.recipe.zope2instance
to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.xmpp.chat`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.xmpp.chat

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
