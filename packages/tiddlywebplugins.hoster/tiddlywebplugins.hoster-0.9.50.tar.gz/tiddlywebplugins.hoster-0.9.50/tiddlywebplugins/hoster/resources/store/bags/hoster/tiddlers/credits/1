TiddlyHoster runs on an [[Ubuntu|http://www.ubuntu.com/]] slice hosted by [[suso.com|http://suso.com/]]. It is built using [[TiddlyWeb|http://tiddlyweb.com]] and a bunch of TiddlyWeb plugins.

A bit of artistic flourish comes from Sarah Collins.

Some of the icons come from a set called [[Silk|http://famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/]]. They are available under a Creative Commons Attribution license.
