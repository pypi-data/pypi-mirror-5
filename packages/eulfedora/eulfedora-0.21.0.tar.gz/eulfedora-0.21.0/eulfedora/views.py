'''Generic, re-usable views for use with Fedora-based Django projects.
Intended to be analogous to `Django's generic views
<http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/generic-views/>`_ .

Using these views (in the simpler cases) should be as easy as::

    from django.conf.urls import *
    from eulfedora.views import raw_datastream, raw_audit_trail

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^(?P<pid>[^/]+)/(?P<dsid>(MODS|RELS-EXT|DC))/$', raw_datastream),
        url(r'^(?P<pid>[^/]+)/AUDIT/$', raw_audit_trail),
    )
