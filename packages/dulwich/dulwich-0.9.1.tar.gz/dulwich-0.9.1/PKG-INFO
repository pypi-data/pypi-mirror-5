Description: 
              Simple Python implementation of the Git file formats and
              protocols. Dulwich is the place where Mr. and Mrs. Git live
              in one of the Monty Python sketches.
        
              All functionality is available in pure Python, but (optional)
              C extensions are also available for better performance.
