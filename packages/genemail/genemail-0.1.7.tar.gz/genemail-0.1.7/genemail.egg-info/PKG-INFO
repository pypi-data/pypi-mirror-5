        .. WARNING::
        
          2013/07/29: genemail is in its very early stages - you should come
          back later.
        
        `genemail` makes creating and sending templated email easier. The
        following features are built-in:
        
        * **Automatic html-to-text conversion** so that all generated emails
          have both a plain-text and an HTML version. Note that if the auto-
          conversion is not sufficient, each version can have it's own
          template.
        
        * **Automatic inlining of CSS** for maximum backward compatibility
          with old and/or problematic email clients.
        
        * **Automatic attachment management** allows a common email template
          to specify default attachments; additional attachments can be added
          to individual emails.
        
        * **Support for DKIM email header generation** so that emails that
          are indeed not spam are less likely to be identified as such.
        
        * **Preview data** allows templates to define sample data so that
          email previews can be generated with predefined data and/or dynamic
          data.
        
        * **Unit of test for generated emails** is made easier thanks to a
          sender mechanism that allows outbound emails to be trapped for
          analysis instead of being delivered.

        =====
        
        Install:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          $ pip install genemail
        
        Given the following package file structure:
        
        ::
        
          -- mypackage/
             `-- templates/
                 `-- email/
                     |-- logo.png
                     |-- invite.html
                     |-- invite.spec         # if missing: defaults are used
                     |     Example content:
                     |       attachments:
                     |         - name:  logo.png
                     |           value: !include-raw logo.png
                     |           cid:   true
                     `-- invite.text         # if missing: auto-generated from .html
        
        Use genemail as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          import genemail, templatealchemy as ta
        
          # configure a genemail manager that uses the local SMTP server
          # and uses mako templates from a python package named 'mypackage'
          manager = genemail.Manager(
            sender   = genemail.SmtpSender(host='localhost', port='25'),
            provider = ta.Manager(
              source   = 'pkg:mypackage:templates/email',
              renderer = 'mako'),
            modifier = genemail.DkimModifier(
              selector = 'selector._domainkey.example.com',
              key      = '/path/to/private-rsa.key',
              )
            )
        
          # get an email template object
          eml = manager.newEmail('invite')
        
          # set some parameters that will be used by mako to render the
          # template
          eml['givenname'] = 'Joe'
          eml['surname']   = 'Schmoe'
        
          # add an ICS calendar invite
          eml.addAttachment(
            name        = 'invite.ics',
            value       = create_invite(...),
            contentType = 'text/calendar; name=invite.ics; method=PUBLISH')
        
          # and send the email
          eml.send()
        
          # the resulting email will:
          #   - have two alternative formats (text/plain and text/html)
          #   - have one top-level attachment (text/calendar)
          #   - have one text/html related attachment (logo.png)
          #   - be DKIM-signed
