inputexec
=========

This program aims to handle button/command binding for headless hosts.
It captures all events from an input device (keyboard, mouse, etc.) and runs commands appropriately.

inputexec was born from the need to pass key presses from a remote control to a Music Player Daemon.


Example usage:

.. code-block:: sh

    inputexec --config=actions.ini --source-file=/dev/input/keyboard
