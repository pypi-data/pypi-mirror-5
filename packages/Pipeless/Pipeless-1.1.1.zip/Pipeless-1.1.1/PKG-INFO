Description: Pipeless
        =========
        
        *A simple framework for building a data pipeline.*
        
        |Build Status|
        
        It's an advanced version of this:
        ``function4(function3(function2(function1(0))))``
        
        It looks like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from pipeless import pipeline
        
            error_handler = lambda item, exception: None
            function, run, _ = pipeline(error_handler)
        
        
            @function
            def add_one(_):
                return _ + 1
            
            list(run([1, 2, 3]))  # [2, 3, 4]
        
        
            @function
            def doubler(_):
                yield _
                yield _ * 2
        
            list(run([1, 2, 3]))  # [2, 4, 3, 6, 4, 8]
        
        *  Pipelines operate over a source iterator (like a generator or a list).
        *  Functions can return 1 Item, None to drop the item, or
           a generator. If a generator is given, the items all continue along the pipeline,
           creating a fork.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
             add_one  doubler
            [1]--|-2----\-----2
            Input        -----4
                            Output [2,4]
        
        *  All exception are caught and handled by the optional ``error_handler`` input argument
           to prevent one broken item from stopping the flow. If the handler returns something,
           that something continues on down the pipeline.
        *  Functions can be grouped with an optional argument on the annotator i.e. ``@function('my_group')``.
           Set up your functions this way and you can skip groups with the ``function_groups_to_skip`` argument
           on the pipeline runner.
        
        Also provides a simple optionally-argumented NamedTuple and a command line interface generator.
        
        See the doc strings in ``pipeline.py`` for a lot more information!
        
        Versions:
        
        - *1.1* Function builders optional.
        - *1.0.1* Fixed ordering problem.
