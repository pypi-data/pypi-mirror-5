        Pylibsass is a Python wrapper around the 
        `libsass <https://github.com/hcatlin/libsas>`_ library. The main goal of this
        library is to provide an easy way to hook SASS compilation into your projects.
        
        It uses the awesome `Watchdog <http://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/>`_ library to
        detect filesystem changes and recompile whenever there are changes detected.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pylibsass
        
            pylibsass.watch("app/static/scss", "app/static/css")
        
        Installation

        Installation is easy:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install pylibsass
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Installing from source is easy. It is recommended to do this from within a 
        virtualenv:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python setup.py develop
        
        To run the tests, you do something similar:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python setup.py test
