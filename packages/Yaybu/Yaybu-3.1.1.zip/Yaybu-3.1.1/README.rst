Yaybu is a push based configuration management tool written in Python with the
goal of helping you tame your servers. You describe your infrastructure in a
simple and flexible YAML-like language and Yaybu works out what needs to happen
to deploy your updates.

All the documentation is available on http://docs.yaybu.com.

Yaybu is very new software, please subscribe to the yaybu-dev mailing list
