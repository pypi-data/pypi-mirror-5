Description: A LaTeX pre-processor that supports alternatives, templates and more.
        
        Main features:
          * Uses LaTeX syntax.
          * Can be used both as a program (the ``alttex`` executable) for final users, 
            or as a separate library for developers. 
          * Create alternative documents from a single source using the commands
            \ALT, \IF, \ELSE, etc. 
          * Support for Jinja2 templates using a LaTeX-like syntax. It can be used as 
            an alternative to traditional LaTeX programming or to supply the LaTeX 
            document with data from different sources such as a Python script, a JSON 
            structure, a database, and others.
