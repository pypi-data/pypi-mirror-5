Description: PasswordStrength
        
          This Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) plugin validates
          passwords against regular expression rules. These rules can
          ensure a passwords strength such as minimum lenth and required
          characthers.
          This plugin contains a patch to plone to use PAS validation.
        
        Requires:
        
         - PluggableAuthService and its dependencies
        
         - (optional) PlonePAS and its dependencies
         
         - Plone 4.1 or 4.2.
        
        
        Installation
        
          Place the Product directory 'PasswordStength' in your 'Products/'
          directory. Restart Zope.
        
          In your PAS 'acl_users', select 'PasswordStrength' from the add
          list.  Give it an id and title, and push the add button.
        
          Enable the 'Validation' plugin interfaces in the after-add screen.
          
          Click on the properties tab and edit the validation rules
          
          To use with plone, you need to install PasswordStrength using quickinstaller
        
          That's it! Test it out.
        
          Note: PasswordStength doesn't currently generate new passwords. This means that
          you will need to change Plones security settings such that users manually enter
          passwords rather than autogenerate them.
        
        
        Implementation
        
          A PAS plugin for Validation checks the password against each regular
          expression listed in the properties. Any rules that fail result in
          the associated error messages being returned.
          
          Plone doesn't use PAS to validate passwords so included is a patch to
          Products.CMFPlone.RegistrationTool.RegistrationTool.testPasswordValidity
          which makes plone use PAS validation plugins.
        
        TODO
        
          1. Do password generation from regexp. This looks possible
             http://stackoverflow.com/questions/492716/reversing-a-regular-expression-in-python
        
          2. Do password expiration
