- Now depends on :mod:`billiard` 3.3.0.7

- Worker accidentally set a default socket timeout of 5 seconds.

=====
:release-date: 2013-11-11 06:30 P.M UTC

- Now depends on :mod:`billiard` 3.3.0.4.

- Python 3: Fixed compatibility issues.

- Windows:  Accidentally showed warning that the billiard C extension

- Django: Tutorial updated with a solution that sets a default
  :envvar:`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` so that it doesn't have to be typed
  in with the :program:`celery` command.

    Also fixed typos in the tutorial, and added the settings
    required to use the Django database backend.

    Thanks to Chris Ward, orarbel.

- Django: Fixed a problem when using the Django settings in Django 1.6.
