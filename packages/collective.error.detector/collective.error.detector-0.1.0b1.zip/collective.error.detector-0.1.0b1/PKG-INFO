Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The package detects, filters and sends requests to a logger. You can use ’collective.recipe.logger’ as a logger.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        What it does is:
        
        1) Gets request which have not been published yet and sends them to the logger.
        
        2) Adds an error information to logs and sends signal `open new storage` if any error happens.
        
        As a result, we will have a bunch of files which will have the following structure::
        
          request
        
          request
            
          .......
            
          error info
        
        I have to note that the package detects only server errors and  is intended to work with a production site.
