        Python keepassx is a python library and a command line utility for working with
        keepassx database files (``.kdb`` files).  This allow you to programatically
        access your usernames/passwords instead of having to use the KeePassX GUI.
        
        The ``keepassx`` module currently supports read only operations (adding entries
        and creating kdb files are a planned feature).  You can list
        your entries::
        
            $ kp -d password.kdb list
            Password:
        
            +---------+----------------------------------+-----------+
            | Title   |               Uuid               | GroupName |
            +---------+----------------------------------+-----------+
            | mytitle | c4d301502050cd695e353b16094be4a7 | Internet  |
            +---------+----------------------------------+-----------+
        
        You can also get a username/password::
        
            $ kp -d demo.kdb get Github
            Password:
        
        
            title:     Github
            username:  githubuser
            url:       github.com/githubuser
