js.xeditable
************

Introduction
============

This library packages `x-editable`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`x-editable`: http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.xeditable``) are published to some URL.
