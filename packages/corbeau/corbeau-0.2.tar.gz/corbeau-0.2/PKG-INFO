        Corbeau is an extension to `Raven <https://github.com/getsentry/raven>`_
        which adds a cert-verifying HTTPS transport.
        
        It is a drop-in replacement for raven.Client:
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> url = "https://foo:bar@example.com/project"
            >>> client = corbeau.Client(url)
            >>> client is raven.base.Raven
            True
            >>> client.registry.get_transport(urlparse.urlparse(url))
            <corbeau.VerifiedHTTPSTransport object at 0x...>
        
        The transport the corbeau client uses does verification of SSL certs
        for HTTPS connections, thanks to `Requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_.
        
        The transport uses a requests.Session object to make requests, accessible
        at corbeau.session.  This means that keep-alive will be used if the
        server supports it.
