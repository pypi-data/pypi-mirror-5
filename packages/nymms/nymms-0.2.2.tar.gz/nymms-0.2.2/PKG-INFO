Description: ===========================================
        NYMMS (Not Your Mother's Monitoring System)
        ===========================================
        
        NYMMS is a monitoring framework that takes inspiration from a lot of different
        places.
        
        It's goals are:
        
        - Independently scalable components
        - Fault tolerant
        - Easily useable in a cloud environment
        - Easy to add new monitors
        
        There are many other goals, but that's a good start.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Currently the main requirements are:
        
        - Python (2.7 - may work on older versions, haven't tested)
        - boto (It currently requires this `boto pull request`_, which is very close to
          being accepted)
        - PyYAML (used in a few backends, will eventually not be a requirement unless
          you need to use those backends)
        - Jinja2 (needed for templating)
