        =============
        
        This package is a release supporting the poster presentation at GCC2013/Oslo.
        The work is still in progres, we will incremently add servers and installation
        instructions to this package.
        
        Installation
        --------------
        
        To install this package you will need either root access or preferabel install into
        your virtualenv. 
        
        ### Installation of WSGI-servers
        
        Some of the WSGI-server require supplementary installation of supporting software/libraries.
        
        One common package to install is **python-dev**, this can be installed by:
        
            sudo apt-get install python-dev build-essential
        
        On Debian/Ubuntu based systems.
        
        #### Fapws3
        In order to install Fapws3, you need to install 1 system package called 'libev'. This packages handles the event-based system calls.
        
            sudo apt-get install libev libev-dev
        
        Inside your virtualenv, installation of Fapws3 is done by:
        
            pip install fapws3
        
        Thats all! Once installed, proceed with configuring your Galaxy instance
        
        #### Gunicorn
        
        Installation of Gunicorn also requires the installation of the **python-dev** library headers. Install the following into your virtualenv: (or even system-wide)
        
            pip install greenlet gunicorn
        
        That's all!
        
        #### Tornado
        
            pip install tornado
        
        #### uWSGI
        
            pip install uwsgi
        
        ### Configuring your Galaxy instance
        
        Open **universe_wsgi.ini** and search for the following section:
        
            [server:main]
            use = egg:Paste#http
        
        You can replace the **egg:Paste#http** by any server supported by this package:
        
            [server:main]
            use = egg:galaxyserver#gunicorn
        	# you can replace gunicorn by: fapws3/tornado
        
        ##### one exception
        uWSGI requires a slightly different setup.
