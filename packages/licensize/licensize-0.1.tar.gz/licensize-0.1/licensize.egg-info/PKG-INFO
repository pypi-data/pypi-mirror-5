Description: Licensize
        =====
        
        Licensize is a super simple app that adds a LICENSE file to your current
        directory.
        
        Installation
        -------
        
        python setup.py
        
        Installation
        -------
        
        python setup.py
        
        Installation
        -------
        
        
             python setup.py
        
        
        Usage
        -------
        
        Just do...
        
            licensize
        
        ...to license the current directory as GPL 3.0 using your git or mercurial
        config name in the copyright notice. Or...
        
            licensize -a 'Hacker Corp.' -l mit -n COPYING
        
        ...to save the MIT license licensed to 'Hacker Corp.' to a COPYING file in the
        current directory.
        
        
        Purpose
        ---------
        
        It's a great script to speed up creating a new repo for a little FOSS licensed
        library or something, like if you want to quickly spin off a rails / Django
        app, or jQuery plugin, as a properly licensed GPL or MIT licensed FOSS software
        package.  Hopefully will help combat "license laziness" which plagues
        github/bitbucket presently with so many un-licensed projects.
