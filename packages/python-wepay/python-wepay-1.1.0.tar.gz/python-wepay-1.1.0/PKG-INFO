        About
        -----
        
        This package started as a part of `Django WePay Application <https://github.com/lehins/django-wepay>`_, but I soon realized it could be useful to other developers in Python community that do not use `Django <https://djangoproject.com>`_. Originally it meant to be an extension of an official `Python WePay SDK <https://github.com/wepay/Python-SDK>`_, but instead it became a replacement with full compatibilty with official WePay version.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        Beta version, but fully functional. Also currently undergoing extensive testing as a part of other application. (there is no reason for me to write separate tests for this package, since all of it's functionality will be tested anyways)
        
        Requirements
        ------------
