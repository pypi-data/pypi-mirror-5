        Inigos are simple sequences which experience loss of information with time.
        They are append-only and grow logarithmically in size with their input,
        instead of linearly, discarding information as they grow.

        The name of the library and data structure goes to Allen Short, who also
        provided the classic movie quote.
        
        David Barbour's explanation of the possible uses of inigos inspired me to
        provide a Python implementation. His article is at
        http://awelonblue.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/exponential-decay-of-history-improved/
        and is worth reading.
