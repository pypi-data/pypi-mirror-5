================

If Hyperspy has been significant to a project that leads to an academic publication,
please acknowledge that fact by citing one or more of the publications below and, if possible, give a link to the Hyperspy website.  At present, we are still 
in the process of writing an academic reference about Hyperspy. However, 
under its previous name, EELSLab, it has been used by its authors and/or 
collaborators in a number of scientific articles that you can cite (
see  :ref:`articles-using-hyperspy`)

* If you have used Hyperspy for curve fitting please cite `Arenal et al. 2008 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399108002015>`_ or `de la Peña et al. 2010 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039602810002529>`_ `get the pdf here <https://sites.google.com/site/lfzagonel/manuscripts/2010PhysicaStatusSolidiA.pdf?attredirects=0>`_

* If you have used Hyperspy for PCA and or ICA of images please cite `Sarahan et al. 2011 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399108002015>`_
