Hyperspy, formely EELSLab, was created by Francisco de la Pe√±a in 2007 during his PhD supervised by Michael Walls and he continues to lead the project to this day.

Since 2010 Hyperspy is maintened by `an active community of developers <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/contributors>`_.

The Hyperspy logo was created by Stefano Mazzucco. It is a modified version of `this figure <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg>`_ and the same GFDL license applies.
 
The website is a fork of the Ipython website.
