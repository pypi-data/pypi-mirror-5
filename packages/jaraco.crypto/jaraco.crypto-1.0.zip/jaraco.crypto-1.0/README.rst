Many of the ideas and much of the code has been adapted from or inspired by
several other projects, including::

 - The code repository was originally a fork of the `ctypescrypto project
   <http://code.google.com/p/ctypescrypto/>`_. The code history includes the
   full history of the ancestral project.
 - The blowfish code was adapted from a module contributed to the community
   by Michael Gilfix.
