This is a Python (2 and 3) library to access the `Github API v3 <http://developer.github.com/v3>`_.
With it, you can manage your `Github <http://github.com>`_ resources (repositories, user profiles, organizations, etc.) from Python scripts.

It covers the **full** API (except recent additions, see "What's missing" bellow), and all methods are tested against the real Github site.

Should you have any question, any remark, or if you find a bug, or if there is something you can do with the API but not with PyGithub, please `open an issue <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues>`_.

PyGithub is stable. I will maintain it up to date with the API, and fix bugs if any, but I don't plan new heavy developments.
