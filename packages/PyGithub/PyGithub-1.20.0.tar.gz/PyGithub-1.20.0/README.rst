This is a Python (2 and 3) library to access the `Github API v3 <http://developer.github.com/v3>`_.
With it, you can manage your `Github <http://github.com>`_ resources (repositories, user profiles, organizations, etc.) from Python scripts.

It covers the **full** API (except recent additions, see "What's missing" bellow), and all methods are tested against the real Github site.

Should you have any question, any remark, or if you find a bug, or if there is something you can do with the API but not with PyGithub, please `open an issue <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues>`_.

PyGithub is stable. I will maintain it up to date with the API, and fix bugs if any, but I don't plan new heavy developments.


What's new?
===========

Thank you, dear stargazers!
---------------------------

Starting today (September 5th, 2013), we now need more than 8 bits to store the number of `stargazers <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/stargazers>`_! Thank you so much!

`Version 1.20.0 <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues?milestone=32&state=closed>`_ (October 20th, 2013) (First Seattle edition)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `Implement <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/196>`_ ``Github.get_hook(name)``. Thank you `klmitch <https://github.com/klmitch>`_ for asking
* In case bad data is returned by Github API v3, `raise <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/195>`_ an exception only when the user accesses the faulty attribute, not when constructing the object containing this attribute. Thank you `klmitch <https://github.com/klmitch>`_ for asking
* `Fix <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/199>`_ parameter public/private of ``Repository.edit``. Thank you `daireobroin449 <https://github.com/daireobroin449>`_ for reporting the issue
* Remove ``Repository.create_download`` and ``NamedUser.create_gist`` as the corrensponding APIs are not documented anymore

What's missing?
