gmusicapi: an unofficial API for Google Play Music
==================================================

gmusicapi allows control of
`Google Music <http://music.google.com>`__ with Python.

.. code-block:: python

    from gmusicapi import Mobileclient
    
    api = Mobileclient()
    api.login('user@gmail.com', 'my-password')
    # => True
    
    library = api.get_all_songs()
    sweet_tracks = [track for track in library if track['artist'] == 'The Cat Empire']
    
    playlist_id = api.create_playlist('Rad muzak')
    api.add_songs_to_playlist(playlist_id, sweet_tracks)
    
**gmusicapi is not supported nor endorsed by Google.**

That said, it's actively maintained, and used in a bunch of cool projects:

-  Malcolm Still's `command line Google Music client <https://github.com/mstill/thunner>`__
   (`screenshot <http://i.imgur.com/Mwl0k.png>`__)
-  Ryan McGuire's `GMusicFS <https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/GMusicFS>`__ - a FUSE
   filesystem linked to your music
-  Kilian Lackhove's `Google Music support <https://github.com/crabmanX/google-music-resolver>`__
   for http://www.tomahawk-player.org
-  `@thebigmunch <https://github.com/thebigmunch>`__'s `syncing scripts <https://github.com/thebigmunch/gmusicapi-scripts>`__
-  David Dooling's `sync scripts for Banshee <https://github.com/ddgenome/banshee-helper-scripts>`__

The project is in the middle of a major change at the moment: the Webclient interface has
gotten horrible to maintain, so I'm working on
switching the the Android app api. This will provide easy All Access support and easier
maintainability going forward. At this point, prefer the Mobileclient to the Webclient
whenever possible.
