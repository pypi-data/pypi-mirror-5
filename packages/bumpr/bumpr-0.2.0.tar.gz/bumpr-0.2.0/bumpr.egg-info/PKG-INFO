Description: ======
        Bump'R
        ======
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Bump'R is a version bumper and releaser allowing in a single command:
        
        - Clean-up release artifact
        - Bump version and tag it
        - Build a source distribution and upload on PyPI
        - Update version for a new development cycle
        
        Bump'R intend to be customizable with the following features:
        
        - Optionnal test suite run before bump
        - Customizable with a config file
        - Overridable by command line
        - Extensible with hooks
        
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Bump'R requires Python 2.6+
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install Bump'R with pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install bumpr
        
        or with easy_install:
        
        ::
        
            $ easy_install bumpr
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can use directly the command line to setup every parameter:
        
        ::
        
            $ bumpr fake/__init__.py README.rst -M -ps dev
        
        But Bump'R is designed to work with a configuration file (``bumpr.rc`` by defaults).
        Some features are only availables with the configuration file like:
        
        - commit message customization
        - hooks configuration
        - multiline test, clean and publish commands
        
        Here's an exemple:
        
        ::
        
            [bumpr]
            file = fake/__init__.py
            vcs = git
            tests = tox
            publish = python setup.py sdist register upload
            clean =
                python setup.py clean
                rm -rf *egg-info build dist
            files = README.rst
        
            [bump]
            unsuffix = true
            message = Bump version {version}
        
            [prepare]
            suffix = dev
            message = Prepare version {version} for next development cycle
        
            [changelog]
            file = CHANGELOG.rst
            bump = {version} ({date:%Y-%m-%d})
            prepare = In development
        
            [readthedoc]
            id = fake
        
        This way you only have to specify which part you want to bump on the command line:
        
        ::
        
            $ bumpr -M  # Bump the major
            $ bumpr     # Bump the default part aka. patch
