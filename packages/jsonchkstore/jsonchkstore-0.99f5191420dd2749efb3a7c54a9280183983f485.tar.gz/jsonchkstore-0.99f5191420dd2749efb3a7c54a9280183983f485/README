chkdag - A layer atop chkstore for DAG storage with JSON for non-leaf nodes.


This storage layer uses a chkstore to provide three features:

- DAG storage, with JSON non-leaf nodes and arbitrary leaf nodes.

- Multi-process-aware root node updates.  Multiple concurrent writers
  leads to merging their respective changes.

- Scanning to detect unlinked nodes.
