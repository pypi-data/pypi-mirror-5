          as a New Zealand phone number. Validates local and international land line
          and mobile numbers just as well as 0800 number validation.
        
        * forms.NZBankAccountNumberField - a form field that validates input

          When strict checking is enabled the bank ID part of account number is validatedm too. 
        
        See the source code for full details.
        
        NZ specific ``settings``
        ------------------------
        
        * ``LOCALFLAVOR_NZ_STRICT`` defaults to ``False``. Add it to your ``settings`` 
          if you want to enable strict validation. Currently, if set to ``True``,
          ``NZBankAccountNumberField`` will also validate if given bank account number's
          bank id is one of the valid ones. See ``django_localflavor_nz.forms.BANK_IDS``
          for full list of valid bank IDs.
        
        
        About django-localflavor-nz
        ===========================
        
        ``django_localflavor_nz`` package was created by Marek Kuziel, because
        New Zealand "localflavor" didn't make it to Django before 
        ``django.contrib.localflavor`` was deprecated in Django 1.5.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the package ``easy_install django-localflavor_nz`` or 
        ``pip install django-localflavor_nz``.
        
        Add ``django_localflavor_nz`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings``.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        ``django test django_localflavor_nz`` will run the tests for this localflavor.
        
        
        About localflavors
        ==================
        
        Django's localflavor packages offer additional functionality for particular
        countries or cultures.
        
        For example, these might include form fields for your country's postal codes,
        phone number formats or government ID numbers.
        
        The localflavors code used to live in Django proper -- in django.contrib.localflavor -- 
        but was separated into standalone packages in Django 1.5 to keep the framework's core clean.
        
        For other localflavor packages, see https://github.com/django/
