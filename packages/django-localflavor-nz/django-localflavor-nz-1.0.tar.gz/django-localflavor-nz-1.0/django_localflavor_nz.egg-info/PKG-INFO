        About django-localflavor-nz
        ===========================
        
        ``django_localflavor_nz`` package was created by Marek Kuziel, because
        New Zealand "localflavor" didn't make it to Django before 
        ``django.contrib.localflavor`` was deprecated in Django 1.5.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply add ``django_localflavor_nz`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        ``django test django_localflavor_nz`` will run the tests for this localflavor.
        
        
        About localflavors
        ==================
        
        Django's localflavor packages offer additional functionality for particular
        countries or cultures.
        
        For example, these might include form fields for your country's postal codes,
        phone number formats or government ID numbers.
        
        Their code used to live in Django proper -- in django.contrib.localflavor -- but
        was separated into standalone packages in Django 1.5 to keep the framework's
        core clean.
        
        For other localflavors, see https://github.com/django/
