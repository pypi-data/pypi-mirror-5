        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Little convenience tool to extract docstrings from a module or class and
        convert them to GitHub Flavoured Markdown:
        
        https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown
        
        Its purpose is to quickly generate ``README.md`` files for small
        projects.
        
        API
        ~~~
        
        The interface consists of the following functions:
        
        -  ``doctrim(docstring)``
        -  ``doc2md(docstring, title)``
        
        You can run this script from the command line like:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ doc2md.py [-a] [--no-toc] [-t title] module-name [class-name] > README.md
        
        Limitations
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        At the moment this is suited only for a very specific use case. It is
        hardly forseeable, if I will decide to improve on it in the near future.
