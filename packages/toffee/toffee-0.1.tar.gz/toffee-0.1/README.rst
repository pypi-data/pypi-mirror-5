Toffee – test object factories
==============================


Toffee helps create test fixtures for ORM model objects.

Example::

    from toffee import Fixture, Factory

    product_factory = Factory(Product, id=Seq())

    class MyFixture(Fixture):

        product_1 = product_factory(desc='cuddly toy')
        product_2 = product_factory(desc='toy tractor')

        user = Factory(User, username='fred')
        order = Factory(Order, user=user, products=[product_1, product_2])


    def test_product_search():

        fixture = MyFixture()
        fixture.setup()

        assert fixture.product_1 in search_products('toy')
        assert fixture.product_2 in search_products('toy')
        ...

        fixture.teardown()

Toffee is similar in scope to `factory_boy <https://github.com/dnerdy/factory_boy>`_.
The differences that prompted me to write a new library are:

- Toffee promotes working with on fixtures as groups of objects to be created
  and destroyed as a unit, rather than individual factories
- Explicit support for setup/teardown of fixtures

Use with Django
---------------

To use this with Django's ORM, import DjangoFactory, which knows how to create
and delete Django model objects correctly::

    from toffee import DjangoFactory as Factory
    from myapp.models import Product

    class MyFixture(Fixture):
        product_2 = Factory(Product, desc='toy tractor')


Use with Storm
--------------

To use this with the `Storm ORM <http://storm.canonical.com/>`_,
import StormFactory, which knows how to create
and delete objects with Storm::

    from toffee import StormFactory
    from myapp.models import Product

    from storm.database import create_database
    from storm.store import Store

    database = create_database('sqlite:')
    Factory = StormFactory.configure(lamdba: Store(database))

    class MyFixture(Fixture):
        product_2 = Factory(Product, desc='toy tractor')


Other ORMs
----------

There is currently no support for other ORMs. Contributions are welcome!

Setup and teardown
------------------

Fixtures don't create any objects until you explicitly set them up::

    fixture = MyFixture()
    fixture.setup()

Fixtures will destroy any objects they've created when you call ``teardown``::

    fixture.teardown()

NB these methods are aliased to ``setUp`` and ``tearDown`` for consistency with
python's unittest library. 

Call these from your test classes' setup/teardown methods::


    class UserFixture(Fixture):
        user = Factory(User, username='fred')
        profile = Factory(Profile, user=user, address='10 Downing Street')

    class TestSuite:

        def setUp(self):
            self.fixtures = UserFixture()
            self.fixtures.setup()

        def tearDown(self):
            self.fixtures.teardown()

        def test_wotsit(self):
            assert self.fixtures.user.username == 'fred'
            assert self.fixtures.user.get_profile().address == \
              '10 Downing Street'


You can also use fixtures as context managers,
in which case setup and teardown will be called automatically 
when you enter/exit the block::

    with UserFixture() as f:
        assert f.user.username == 'fred'
        assert f.profile.address == '10 Downing Street'


Defining factories
------------------

The simplest approach is to create a new Factory for every object required::

    class MyFixture(Fixture):
        fred = Factory(User, username='fred', is_admin=False)
        albert = Factory(User, username='albert', is_admin=True)

You can avoid repeating code by predefine factories for commonly used model
classes::

    user_factory = Factory(User, is_admin=False, is_active=True)

    class MyFixture(Fixture):

        ursula = user_factory(username='ursula')
        inigo = user_factory(username='inigo')
        albert = user_factory(username='albert', is_admin=True)

Factories can reference other factories to autocreate related objects::

    company_factory = Factory(Company, name=Seq('megacorp-%d'))
    employee_factory = Factory(Employee, id=Seq(int), company=company_factory)

If ``employee_factory`` is called without a company argument,
it will generate a fresh one using ``company_factory``.

Sequences
---------

When creating multiple objects of the same type you can use the
:class:`~toffee.Seq` class to avoid manually specifying unique values for
fields::

    product_factory = Factory(Product, sku=Seq('%04d', 0))

    class MyFixture(Fixture):
        p1 = product_factory()
        p2 = product_factory()
        p3 = product_factory()

This would assign ``p1.sku = '0000'``, ``p2.sku = '0001'``  and so on.

The first argument to Seq can be a string (eg ``'user-%d'``)
or any callable (eg ``int`` or ``lambda n: 'badger' * n``).
The second argument is the starting value
(default 0)


Object relationships and foreign keys
-------------------------------------

Suppose you have a bug tracking application. 
You might have one model object called ``Bug`` and another called ``Product`` 
– bugs always belong to a product.

How to set up a fixture containing a product with multiple bugs?

The simplest way is
to create all objects and link between them::

    class BugFixture(Fixture):

        product = Factory(Product, name='my amazing software')
        bug1 = Factory(Bug, comment="it doesnt work", product=product)
        bug2 = Factory(Bug, comment="it still doesnt work", product=product)

Now when we setup the fixture, toffee will figure out the relationships we need
to create the object graph - a single Product instance, linked to two bugs::

    with BugFixture() as f:
        assert f.bug1.product is f.product
        assert f.bug1.product is f.bug2.product


Suppose we write a lot of tests, and we need a lot of fixtures. To avoid having
to repeat a lot of code we can predefine the factories::

    product_factory = Factory(Product, name=Seq('Product-%d'))
    bug_factory = Factory(Bug, comment=Seq('Bug #%d'), product=product_factory)


Notice the ``product=product_factory`` bit. Using this ``bug_factory`` 
will call ``product_factory`` to generate a fresh product
for us every time::

    class BugsInSeparateProductsFixture(Fixture):

        bug1 = bug_factory()
        bug2 = bug_factory()

    with BugsInSeparateProductsFixture() as f:
        assert f.bug1.product.name == 'product-0'
        assert f.bug2.product.name == 'product-1'


If we want both bugs to link to a single product, we can just tell the second
bug to reuse the product from bug1::

    class BugsInSameProductFixture(Fixture):

        bug1 = bug_factory()
        bug1 = bug_factory(product=bug1.product)

    with BugsInSameProductFixture() as f:
        assert f.bug1.product.name == 'product-0'
        assert f.bug2.product.name == 'product-0'


Post-creation configuration
---------------------------

Override the ``configure`` method to add custom configuration of objects::

    class MyFixture(Fixture):

        user = userfactory()

        def configure(self):
            add_user_to_group('admin', self.user)



Extending fixtures
------------------

Class inheritance is the preferred way to extend fixtures::

    user_factory = Factory(User, username=Seq('user-%d'), is_admin=False)
        
    class UserFixture(Fixture):
        fred = user_factory()

    class UserWithAdministratorFixture(UserFixture):
        sheila = user_factory(is_admin=True)


But you can also extend fixtures in their constructor::

    with UserFixture(sheila=user_factory(is_admin=True)) as f:
        assert f.sheila.is_admin
        assert not f.fred.is_admin
