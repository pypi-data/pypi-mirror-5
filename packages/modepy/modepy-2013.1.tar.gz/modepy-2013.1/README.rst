modepy
======

modepy is a simple package to help you set up high order discretizations by
providing orthogonal basis functions and interpolation nodes.

It is (closely) based on Matlab routines by Tim Warburton and Jan Hesthaven from the book:

    Hesthaven, Jan S., and Tim Warburton. Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods:
    Algorithms, Analysis, and Applications. 1st ed. Springer, 2007.
