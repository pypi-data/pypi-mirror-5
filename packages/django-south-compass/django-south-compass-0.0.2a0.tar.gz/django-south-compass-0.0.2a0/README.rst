What is it?
-----------

Django south compass is a tool to guide your south migrations.

It is a git hook that keeps your south migrations in sync with your repository.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-south-compass

Usage
-----

Go to your git repo and do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ django-south-compass install

This will setup a git hook so that whenever you checkout a branch, you're
migrations are synced up.

Eg.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git branch
        * master
        feature1
        feature2

    $ git checkout feature1
    # Migrates to any new migrations added in feature1

    $ git checkout master
    # Migrates back to the last migration in master

    $ git checkout feature2
    # Migrates to any new migrations added in feature2

    $ git checkout feature1
    # Migrates back to the last migration common between
    # feature1 and feature2, then migrates forward to feature1
