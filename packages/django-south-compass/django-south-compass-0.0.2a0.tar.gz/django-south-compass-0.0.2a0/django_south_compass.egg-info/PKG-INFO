        What is it?
        -----------
        
        Django south compass is a tool to guide your south migrations.
        
        It is a git hook that keeps your south migrations in sync with your repository.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install django-south-compass
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Go to your git repo and do:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ django-south-compass install
        
        This will setup a git hook so that whenever you checkout a branch, you're
        migrations are synced up.
        
        Eg.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git branch
                * master
                feature1
                feature2
        
            $ git checkout feature1
            # Migrates to any new migrations added in feature1
        
            $ git checkout master
            # Migrates back to the last migration in master
        
            $ git checkout feature2
            # Migrates to any new migrations added in feature2
        
            $ git checkout feature1
            # Migrates back to the last migration common between
            # feature1 and feature2, then migrates forward to feature1
