OpenGEODE
=========

OpenGEODE is a tiny open-source SDL editor that is developed for
the purpose of providing an easy to use and free state machine editor and
Ada code generator to the TASTE toolchain from the European Space Agency,
running in combination with ESA's ASN.1 "Space Certifiable" ASN.1 compiler.

SDL is the Specification and Description Language (Z100 standard from ITU-T).

This is NOT related to the graphical Simple DirectMedia Layer libraries!

Installation
============

Pre-requisites
--------------

There are thrww majors dependencies for OpenGEODE:

- Pyside (the Qt bindings for Python) and the ANTLR runtime to be
- Python ANTLR Runtime
- PyGraphviz

If you use pip to install OpenGEODE, these dependencies should be installed
automatically. However, note that installing PySide from pip requires some
work and is not straightforward.

If you are using a Linux Debian-based distribution (including Ubuntu),
I would recommended to install PySide using your package manager:
You should also install pygraphviz using the same method, for convenience.

$ sudo apt-get install python-pyside python-pygraphviz

And to install pip:

$ sudo apt-get install pip

The Python 2.7 ANTLR 3.1.3 runtime is not part of Debian packages. Install
it with pip (or download and install manually the package):

$ pip install antlr_python_runtime

On Windows:

You need to download and install Python, Pyside, and pip (binaries are
available on respective websites)

On FreeBSD:

PySide is available through the ports.
You can also use easy_install to install it.
Use pip to install the ANTLR runtime (see above)

Automatic installation (recommended)
------------------------------------

$ pip install opengeode

This is sufficient to get opengeode running. It will install ANTLR and
PySide, which are the only two dependencies.

In addition OpenGEODE is capable of generating code for embedded, real-
time systems in the Ada programming language, with compact and efficient
data manipulation and binary encoding using the ASN.1 notation.

To get the full benefits of SDL and OpenGEODE, consider installing
TASTE, that is a complete development environment dedicated to
real-time, embedded systems from the European Space Agency.

TASTE also allows the transparent integration and communication between
models developed by commercial tools such as Matlab-Simulink and 
Real-Time Developer Studio.
