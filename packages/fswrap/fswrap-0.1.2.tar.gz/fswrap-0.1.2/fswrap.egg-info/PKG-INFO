Description: Version 0.1.2
        
        Unified object oriented interface for interacting with file system
        objects. File system operations in python are distributed across
        modules: os, os.path, fnmatch, shutil and distutils. This module
        attempts to make the right choices for common operations to provide a
        single interface.
        
        This was extracted from the `hyde project`_ with minor changes.
