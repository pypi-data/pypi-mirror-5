        ===================
        
        mark2 is a minecraft server wrapper, written in python and twisted. It aims to
        be *the* definitive wrapper, providing a rich feature-set and a powerful plugin
        interface. It has no requirement on craftbukkit.
        
        features
        --------
        
        * Your server runs in the background
        * Multiple users can attach at once, with their own local prompt and command
          buffer
        * Built in monitoring using cpu, memory, players and connectivity
        * Rich screen/tmux-like client with built-in monitoring, tab-complete, command
          history, etc
        
        plugins
        -------
        
        * Powerful scheduling plugin, with a cron-like syntax. You can hook onto events
          like ``@serverstopped`` to run a
          cartograph, or run ``save`` on an interval
        * Automatically restart the server when it crashes, runs out of memory, or
          stops accepting connections
        * Notifications via Prowl, Pushover, NotifyMyAndroid or email if something goes
          wrong.
        * Relay in-game chat to IRC, and vice-versa
        * MCBouncer ban support, even on a vanilla server.
        * Read an RSS feed (such as a subreddit feed) and announce new entries in-game
        * Back up your map and server log when the server stops
        * Print a random message at an interval, e.g. '[SERVER] Lock your chests with
          /lock'
        * Respond to user commands, e.g. '<Notch> !teamspeak' could `msg Notch Join our
          teamspeak server at xyz.com`
