TODOs:
* support for date facets
* result iterator (with __len__ on results object)
* support for "navtree" and "level" arguments for path queries

* provide decorator for solr exceptions
* add signal handlers (see store.py)
* add a configurable queue limit for large transactions
* mapping from accessor name to attribute name, i.e. getTitle -> title,
  preferably via <copyField> tags in the solr schema
* evaluate http://www.gnuenterprise.org/~jcater/solr.py as a replacement
