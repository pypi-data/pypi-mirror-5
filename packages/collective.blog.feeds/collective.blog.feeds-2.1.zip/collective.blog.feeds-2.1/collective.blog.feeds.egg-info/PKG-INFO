Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.blog.feeds provides blog feeds for standard Plone folders and 
        collections. It builds on basesyndication and fatsyndication and uses their
        architecture and templates, but provides concrete implementations for
        standard Plone content.
        
        To create the feeds all you need to do is make collective.blog.feeds be a 
        dependent product in your buildout, and include the ZCML one way or another.
        Plone folders, large folders and collections will then gain a set of new
        views: atom.xml, feed.rdf, feed11.rdf, rss.xml and itunes.xml.
        
        Yes, *all* folders get this view. No, you don't have to enable syndication
        on the folder, which also means you don't have to find that enable syndication
        tab action that for some reason is invisible by default so that you can't turn
        on the standard RSS feed without knowing Plone inside and out for some
        incomprehensible reason.
        
        It also adds the feeds to the plone header with the standard 
        '<link rel="alternate" ...>' type of header links. There probably should be
        a way to turn that off or on, but currently there isn't.
        
        collective.blog.feeds supports Plone 3 and Plone 4.
        
        
        The development of collective.blog.feeds was sponsored by the 
        **Bergen Public Library** - http://www.nettbiblioteket.no
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        By default this product will only use Documents, News Items and Files as 
        entries in the blog feed. If you want to use some custom content types you
        will need to do two things:
        
        1. Provide an IFeedEntry adapter. Look at the "adapters.py" file for an
           examples made for News Item. As you see it's not particularily complicated.
           You also need to register the adapter, look in configure.zcml to see how
           that is done.
           
        2. Create a property in portal.properties/site_properties called "blog_types"
           of the "lines" type. Then in that property add each content type that
           your site should see as being blog entries.
           
           
        Podcasts
        --------
        
        collective.blog.feeds provides an adapter for the ATFile content type with
        podcast enclosure support. You can therefore make podcasts simply by making
        a folder and sticking files in it.
        
        If you have a custom class for podcasts, you need to add an adapter for it so
        that the file get's picked up properly and inserted into an enclosure in the
        feed. If your podcast class subclasses ATFile or implements the IATFile
        interface you shouldn't need to do anything. If you don't, but provide a
        similar interface, you can try to use the ATFile adapter, by adding this to
        your configure.zcml:
        
          <adapter
            for="<your types class or interface>"
            provides="Products.basesyndication.interfaces.IFeedEntry"
            factory="collective.blog.feeds.adapters.FileFeedEntry"
            /> 
        
          <adapter
            for="<your types class or interface>"
            provides="Products.basesyndication.interfaces.IEnclosure"
            factory="collective.blog.feeds.adapters.ATFileEnclosure"
            />
        
        If your podcast class doesn't implement an interface similar to ATFile, you
        need to make your own adapter. It's not tricky, take a look at the adapters.py
        file to see how the ATFile adapter is done.
        
        
        What this product do not have
        -----------------------------
        
        There is no Plone Control Panel in this product, nor will there ever be one,
        so you need to change the settings through the ZMI. There will also never be
        any per-folder settings, as that would require extending the schema for 
        folders or have a dedicated blog type, both which will defeat the main goal
        of this product: simplicity and flexibility.
        
        This product will never use doctests to test anything besides documentation.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.1 (2013-05-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Instead of putting the whole image from the News Item in the feed, I now
          put a 'mini' image with a link, similar to how the News Item is
          being rendered with the normal view. [regebro]
        
        Tested with Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.5 and 4.3.
        Plone 3 is no longer supported, but may still work.
        
        
        2.0 (2013-05-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Register the feed viewlet for IBaseFolder
          [erral]
        
        - Use 'index' instead 'render' for the viewlet class to allow overriding via z3c.jbot.
          [erral]
          
        - Now punts to using Plone 4.3's built in syndication under Plone 4.3.
          Note that since Plone 4.3's syndication is turned off by default, you will have to
          configure it before it works.
          [regebro]
        
        - File links go to the files web view instead of the file. Podcast readers should use the
          enclosure in any case.
