Description: ========================================
        About pyonep
        ========================================
        This project contains a package called "pyonep".  The pyonep package is an
        API library with python bindings to the Exosite One Platform API.  The API is 
        exposed over HTTP in a JSON RPC style interface.
        
        Recommended with python 2.6 or later.

        ========================================
        Required Python Packages
        ========================================
        ****************************************
        1) python-simplejson  (python 2.5 and earlier only)
        ****************************************
        https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson
        
        Simplejson only necessary for python version 2.5 and earlier.  For python 2.6 
        and later, the library uses the native "python-json" package.
        
        ========================================
        Installation
        ========================================
        1.) Unpack the distribution archive (if necessary)
        
        2.) Navigate into the root "pyonep" directory
        
        3.) Install the package:
        
        	python setup.py install
        
        4.) If you do not want to install the package, or cannot due to system 
        limitations, simply copy the ./pyonep/pyonep folder into the same folder as your
        script.  Or, alternatively, add the ./pyonep/pyonep folder to your sys.path.
        
        ========================================
        Quick Start
        ========================================
        
        There are two primary ways to use pyonep: buffered
        access, and direct access. 
        
        1.) Buffered access: import per:
        
        	from pyonep.datastore import Datastore
        
        This library requires you to initialize with the following parameters:
        
        - cik: a 40 character "client interface key" that authenticates your 
                application with the One Platform
        
        - interval: number of seconds between One Platform publish activity.  Even if
                your application calls the "write" function more often than this 
                interval, the data will be grouped to be published at this interval
        
        - autocreate: dataport parameter setup - see the One Platform documentation
                for more information about dataport parameters.
        
        - datastore_config: local write buffer and read cache parameter setup
        
        - transport_config: Exosite server parameter setup
        
        For examples, reference example scripts in the ./pyonep/examples/ folder.  
        Note that to run the examples without installing the pyonep package, the 
        example script must be located in the root folder (with ./pyonep as a 
        sub-folder).
        
        2.) It is also possible to use onep.py directly, passing the cik with each request.
