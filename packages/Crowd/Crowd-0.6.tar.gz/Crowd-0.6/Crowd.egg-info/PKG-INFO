Description: python-crowd
        ============
        
        python-crowd is a python client library to the Atlassian Crowd REST API.
        
        This library may be useful to you if you wish to create an application
        that authenticates users against Crowd or integrate with Crowd's SSO.
        
        This project has no official status within Atlassian and is provided as
        a service to the programming community. I hope that you find it useful.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Docs are built automatically by sphinx. You can build them yourself
        in the doc directory or access them at
        <http://aelse.github.com/python-crowd/>.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Some example invocations are provided in the examples directory, and
        are included in the built documentation.
        
        The unit tests may also be instructive.
