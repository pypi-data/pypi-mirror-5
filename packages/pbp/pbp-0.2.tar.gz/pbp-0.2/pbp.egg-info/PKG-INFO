Description: pbp
        
        v0.2 - experimental
        
        PBP[0] is a simple python wrapper around libsodium, to provide basic
        functionality resembling PGP. It uses scrypt for a KDF and a much
        simpler packet format, which should be much harder to fingerprint and
        also provides a forward secrecy mode.
        
        Installation
        
        pip install pbp
        
        you possibly need to run (or an equivalent command) sudo apt-get install git
        python-virtualenv gcc python-dev libffi-dev to satisfy all basic dependencies.
        
        Design goals:
        
         1. use modern crypto
         2. provide similar functionality to PGP
         3. be extensible
         4. difficult to identify based on fingerprinting
         5. provide extensive testing
         6. strive for security
        
        Crypto
        
        Cryptographic primitives are based on the NaCl library from
        http://nacl.cr.yp.to. The KDF used is scrypt.
        
        PGP-like
        
        Provides basic public key encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify and secret key
        encrypt/decrypt modes, as well as the ability to sign, verify, list,
        generate, export and import keys.
        
        Extensibility
        
        using pbp and the underlying pysodium[1] library it's easy to extend
        pbp.  Some examples are the experimental forward secrecy mode (see
        description in docs/chaining-dh.txt), the support for ECDH key
        exchanges from the command-line and generation of arbitrarily large
        random byte streams.

            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysodium
        
        Fingerprinting
        
        pbp tries to avoid to store any sensitive plaintext info, the
        encrypted files all should look like random noise. for a description
        of the packet formats see docs/fileformats.txt.
        
        Testing
        
        All py files come with their internal tests, unit tests are in
        tests.py, and commandline functionality is tested in test.sh.
        
        Security
        
        pbp locks the process memory, so it cannot be swapped to disk. Also
        pbp uses SecureString[2] to overwrite sensitive key material after
        usage in memory, so keys have a short window of opportunity to leak.

        Usage
        
        Generate a key
        
           pbp.py -g -n alice
        
        sending howdy.txt using public key encryption from alice to bob
        
           pbp.py -c -S alice -r bob -i howdy.txt
        
        decrypt an encrypted file using public key crypto
        
           pbp.py -d -S bob -i howdy.txt.pbp
        
        sending howdy.txt using secret key encryption
        
           pbp.py -c -i howdy.txt
        
        decrypt an encrypted file using secret key crypto
        
           pbp.py -d -i howdy.txt.pbp
        
        sign howdy.txt
        
           pbp.py -s -S alice -i /howdy.txt
        
        verify howdy.txt
        
           pbp.py -v -i howdy.txt.sig
        
        sign bobs key
        
           pbp.py -m -S alice -n bob
        
        check sigs on carols key
        
           pbp.py -C -n carol
        
        alice encrypts howdy.txt to bob using experimental forward secret mode
        
           pbp.py -e -S alice -r bob -i howdy.txt -o ./secret-message
        
        bob decrypts howdy.txt from alice using experimental forward secret mode
        
           pbp.py -E -S bob -r alice -i ./secret-message
        
        initiate ECDH key exchange
        
           pbp.py -D1
        
        respond to ECDH key exchange
        
           pbp.py -D2 -Dp 'public component from D1'
        
        finish ECDH key exchange
        
          pbp.py -D3 -Dp 'public component from D2' -De 'secret exponent from D1'
        
        random streaming 23GByte of cryptographic randomness
        
          pbp.py -R -Rs 23G -o /mnt/huge_fs/random_data

        [0] also it's very funny to say pbp with a mouth full of dry cookies.
        don't try this in company!
