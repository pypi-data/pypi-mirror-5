INSTALLING
----------

To install full PPlus environment for Unix, execute the pplus_add_node.py
script from current directory. Execute::

    $ ./pplus_add_node.py --help
    
for all options.

The following steps are performed:
 - Proper NFS client is installed if not present
 - Specified user (default 'pplus') is created in the system; the user is
   password-less and cannot perform direct login
 - Home directory of user 'pplus' is populated with skeleton directories
 - Configuration file (/etc/pplus/pplus.cfg) is edited
 - A script performing common PPlus operational tasks (mounting remote disk
   space, starting Parallel Python server) is installed as system service

Uninstall commands are written at the end of the script.
