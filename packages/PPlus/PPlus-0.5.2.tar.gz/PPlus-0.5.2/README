About
=====

**PPlus** is a simple environment to execute Python code in parallel on many
machines without much effort.
It is actually a fork of `Parallel Python <http://www.parallelpython.com/>`_,
another simple but powerful framework for parallel execution of python code,
which lacks features needed for effective use in our daily research.
