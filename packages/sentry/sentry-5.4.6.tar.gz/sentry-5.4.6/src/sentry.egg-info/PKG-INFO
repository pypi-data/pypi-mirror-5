        ======
        
        Sentry is a realtime event logging and aggregation platform. It specializes
        in monitoring errors and extracting all the information needed to do a proper
        post-mortem without any of the hassle of the standard user feedback loop.
        
        Sentry is a Server
        ------------------
        
        The Sentry package, at its core, is just a simple server and web UI. It will
        handle authentication clients (such as `Raven <https://github.com/getsentry/raven-python>`_)
        and all of the logic behind storage and aggregation.
        
        That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The primary implementation is in
        Python, but it contains a full API for sending events from any language, in
        any application.
