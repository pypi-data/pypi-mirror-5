Description: # utterson
        ###tl;dr;
        Utterson is a ncurses based management UI for Jekyll based sites. A specific set of conventions are defined and if followed allows utterson to manage many aspects of a Jekyll site.
        
        ###ntl;
        Utterson is primarily a management wrapper for blogs and sites that leverage Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generation tool that is blog aware. At it's core, Jekyll is just a transformation engine that takes text files written in specific markup languages and converts them to a static web site. Jekyll is very flexible, allowing the end users to leverage it any way they would like. This flexibility does come at a cost, Jekyll only provides the raw tools to build a full blog. Standardized management tools and gui's do not fit into the Jekyll mindset. Those are layers the end user is expected to design and implement.
        
        Utterson was created specifically to provide a single convention for a Jekyll based site. By standardizing on a single convention, a management interface could be written that allows for automation of many tasks. Interestingly, the full power of Jekyll is still available but by following the conventions users can take advantage of the management functionality utterson provides.
        
        Utterson was initially created to manage a personal blog. The choice of python and ncurses was simply for shell based management and because why not. Any and all enhancement ideas are welcomed.
