smc.mw
======

A mediawiki-compatible parser for Python.

Using
=====

To run the tests::

 $ make -C tests

The test result can be found in ``tests/out/report.html``.

A command line tool is available, too (installed as "mw")::

 $ echo "''Hello World''" | python smc/mw/tool.py
 <html><body><p><i>Hello World</i>
 </p></body></html>

Differences
===========

For specific differences, see the `test results`_.

* __TOC__ and other magic words must appear on a line on their own, while MediaWiki allows them everyhwere with some strange consequences.

The parser uses the grako_ parser generator for PEG grammars by ResQSoft Inc. and Juancarlo AÃ±ez.
