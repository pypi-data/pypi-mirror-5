__NOTOC__

==smc.mw==

A mediawiki-compatible parser for Python.

=== Using ===

To run the tests:

<pre>
$ make -C tests
</pre>

The test result can be found in tests/out/report.html.

A command line tool is available, too (installed as "mw"):

<pre>
$ echo "''Hello World''" | python smc/mw/tool.py
<html><body><p><i>Hello World</i>
</p></body></html>
</pre>

=== Differences ===

For specific differences, see the [http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://github.com/lambdafu/smc.mw/blob/master/tests/out/report-0001.html test results].

* _&#95;TOC__ and other magic words must appear on a line on their own, while MediaWiki allows them everyhwere with some strange consequences.

===Thanks===

The parser uses the [https://bitbucket.org/apalala/grako grako] parser
generator for PEG grammars by ResQSoft Inc. and Juancarlo AÃ±ez.
