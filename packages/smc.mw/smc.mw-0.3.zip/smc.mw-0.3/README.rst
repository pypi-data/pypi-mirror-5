Using
=====

To run the tests::

 $ make -C tests

The test result can be found in ``tests/out/report.html``.

A command line tool is available, too (installed as "mw")::

 $ echo "''Hello World''" | python smc/mw/tool.py
 <html><body><p><i>Hello World</i>
 </p></body></html>

Differences
===========

For specific differences, see the `test results`_.

* __TOC__ and other magic words must appear on a line on their own, while MediaWiki allows them everyhwere with some strange consequences.
* Not supported right now: __NOEDITSECTION__, __NEWSECTIONLINK, __NONEWSECTIONLINK__.

.. _test results: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://github.com/lambdafu/smc.mw/blob/master/tests/out/report-0003.html

ToDo
====

* Test 843: Section extraction, <pre> around bogus header (bug 10309)
  This should be fixed, as it affects parser extensions (math element,
  etc), too.  For this, the preprocessor grammar needs to include
  specific (but not all) XML elements parsed (counterexample: div
  elements are transparent for headings, pre elements are not).

Thanks
======

The parser uses the grako_ parser generator for PEG grammars by ResQSoft Inc. and Juancarlo AÃ±ez.
