        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `ICanHaz.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`ICanHaz.js`: http://icanhazjs.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.icanhaz``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``icanhaz`` from ``js.icanhaz`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.icanhaz import icanhaz
          >>> icanhaz.need()
        
        or::
        
          >>> from js.icanhaz import icanhaz_no_mustache
          >>> icanhaz_no_mustache.need()
