        Flask-OAuthlib is an extension to Flask that allows you to interact with
        remote OAuth enabled applications. On the client site, it is a replacement
        for Flask-OAuth. But it does more than that, it also helps you to create
        oauth providers.
        
        Flask-OAuthlib relies on oauthlib_.
