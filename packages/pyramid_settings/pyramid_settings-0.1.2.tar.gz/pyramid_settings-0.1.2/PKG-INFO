Description: pyramid_settings
        ================
        
        `pyramid_settings` is simplest package (2 functions to be fair) that enables
        you to load python modules as pyramid settings files.
        
        TL;DR; You can ditch most of your .ini files and store your settings in
        clean python.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
            from pyramid.config import Configurator
        
            from pyramid_settings import load_settings
        
        
            def main(global_config, **settings):
                """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
        
                """
        
                load_settings(__name__, settings, config=global_config)
        
                config = Configurator(settings=settings)
                config.scan()
                return config.make_wsgi_app()
        
        and this is all you need (if you use paster ini files and pserv) to be able to use:
        
            $ pserv development.ini pysettings=settings.py,base.py,roman.py
        
        
        Warning

        production (trust me - don't trust me). Contributions, critique, angry letters
        and such are welcome.
