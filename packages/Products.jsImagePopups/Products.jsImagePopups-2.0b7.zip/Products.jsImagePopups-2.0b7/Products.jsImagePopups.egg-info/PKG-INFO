Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Products.jsImagePopups provides a jQuery lightbox plugin to open
        image popups without using a new browser window.
        
        By default links pointing to *image_view_fullscreen*, having a *rel*
        attribute beginning with *lightbox* or contained in an element with
        class *photoAlbumEntry* are using the provided plugin. This includes
        the *news item* view the *album* view and the *image* of plone.
        
        To activate the plugin for your own view either set the *rel* attribute
        on the desired links or instantiate the links on your own, for an example
        on how to do this have a look at the *browser/lightbox.init.js* file.
        
        Changing the behaviour of the lightbox may be done by changing the *jsImagePopups*
        property in the *site_properties* property sheet or by activating the
        plugin by yourself and providing a custom settings object.
