        An easy way for the NSA to see what's going on in our Django projects.
        Let's ~~destroy the right to privacy~~ fight terrorism together!
        
        ## Freedom matters.
        
        This particular app was written to join the forces of @goshakkk's [nsa_panel](https://github.com/goshakkk/nsa_panel) for Ruby on Rails and 
        @plausibility's [flask-nsa](https://github.com/plausibility/flask-nsa) for Flask.
        
        ## Enforce.
        
        Add `nsa` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` to your project's `settings.py` file.  
        And this to your project's `urls.py` file: `url(r'^nsa/', include('nsa.urls'))`  
        Test if everything is free as it should be: [http://localhost:8000/nsa](http://localhost:8000/nsa) (Use nsa/nsa as credentials).
        
        ## Enjoy.
        
        Share the ~~end of privacy~~ good news (or don't, after all users shouldn't know too much):
        
        > Dear X users, 
        
        > You may be aware of reports alleging that X and several other Internet
        > companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to
        > give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. We would
        > like to respond to the press reports, and give you the facts. 
        
        > X is not and has never been part of any program to give the US or any
        > other government direct access to our servers. We have never received a
        > blanket request or court order from any government agency asking for
        > information or metadata in bulk, like the one Verizon reportedly
        > received. We hadn't even heard of PRISM before yesterday. 
        
        > When governments ask X for data, we review each request carefully to
        > make sure they always follow the correct processes and all applicable
        > laws, and then only provide the information if is required by law. We
        > will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and
        > secure. Any suggestion that X is disclosing information about our users’
        > Internet activity on such a scale is completely false. 
        
        > We strongly encourage all governments to be much more transparent about
        > all programs aimed at keeping the public safe. It's the only way to
        > protect everyone's civil liberties and create the safe and free society
        > we all want over the long term. We here at X understand that the U.S.
        > and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens’
        > safety—including sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of
        > secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the freedoms we
        > all cherish.
        
        \o/ yay.
