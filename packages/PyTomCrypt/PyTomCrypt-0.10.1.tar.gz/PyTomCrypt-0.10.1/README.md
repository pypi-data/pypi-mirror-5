PyTomCrypt
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikeboers/PyTomCrypt.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mikeboers/PyTomCrypt) 

This package is a Python 2/3 wrapper around LibTomCrypt. The API is designed to be conceptually similar to LibTomCrypt, but to be as "Pythonic" as possible.

[Read the Docs](http://mikeboers.github.io/PyTomCrypt/), and good luck!
