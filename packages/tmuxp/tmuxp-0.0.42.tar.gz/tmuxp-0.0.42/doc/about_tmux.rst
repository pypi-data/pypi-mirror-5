The Tao of tmux
===============

.. figure:: _static/tao-tmux-screenshot.png

    BSD-licensed terminal multiplexer.

tmux is geared for developers and admins who interact regularly with
CLI (text-only interfaces)

In the world of computers, there are 2 realms:

1. The text realm
2. The graphical realm

Tmux resides in the text realm. This is about fixed-width fonts and that
old fashioned black terminal.

tmux is to the console what a desktop is to gui apps. It's a world inside
the text dimension. Inside tmux you can:

- multitask inside the terminal, run multiple applications.
- have multiple command lines (pane) in the same window
- have multiple windows (window) in the workspace (session)
- switch between multiple workspaces, like virtual desktops

CLI Power Tool
--------------

Multiple applications or terminals to run on the same screen by splitting
up 1 terminal into multiple.

One screen can be used to edit a file, and another may be used to
``$ tail -F`` a logfile.

You can switch between the windows you create.

Resume everything later
-----------------------

You can leave tmux and all applications running (detach), log out, make a
sandwich, and re-(attach), all applications are still running!

Manage workflow
---------------

- System administrators monitor logs and services.
- Programmers like to have an editor open with a CLI nearby.

Applications running on a remote server can be launched inside of a tmux
session, detached, and reattached next timeyour `"train of thought"`_ and
work.

Multitasking. Preserving the thinking you have.

Installing tmux
===============

Tmux is packaged on most Linux and BSD systems.

For the freshest results on how to get tmux installed on your system,
"How to install tmux on <my distro>" will do, as directions change and are
slightly different between distributions.

This documentation is writtenf for version **1.8**. It's important that
you have the latest stable release of tmux. The latest stable version is
viewable on the `tmux homepage`_.

**Mac OS X** users may install that latest stable version of tmux through
`MacPorts`_, `fink`_ or `Homebrew`_ (aka brew).

If **compiling from source**, the dependencies are `libevent`_ and
`ncurses`_.

.. _tmux homepage: http://tmux.sourceforge.net/
.. _libevent: http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
.. _ncurses: http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

.. _Homebrew: http://www.brew.sh

Using tmux
==========

Start a new session
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tmux

That's all it takes to launch yourself into a tmux session.

.. tip:: Common pitfall

    Running ``$ tmux list-sessions`` or any other command for listing tmux
    entities (such as ``$ tmux list-windows`` or ``$ tmux list-panes``).
    This can generate the error "failed to connect to server".
    
    This could be because:

        - tmux server has killed its' last session, killing the server.
        - tmux server has encountered a crash. (tmux is highly stable,
          this will rarely happen)
        - tmux has not be launched yet at all.

.. _Prefix key:

The prefix key
--------------

Tmux hot keys have to be pressed in a special way. **Read this
carefully**, then try it yourself.

First, you press the *prefix* key. This is ``C-b`` by default.

Release. Then pause. For less than second. Then type what's next.

``C-b o`` means: Press ``Ctrl`` and ``b`` at the same time. Release,
Then press ``o``.

**Remember, prefix + short cut!** ``C`` is ``Ctrl`` key.

Session Name
------------

Sessions can be *named upon creation*.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tmux new-session [-s session-name]

Sessions can be *renamed after creation*.

=============== =========================================================
Command         .. code-block:: bash

                    $ tmux rename-session <sesion-name>

Short cut       ``Prefix`` + ``$``
=============== =========================================================

Window Name
-----------

Windows can be *named upon creation*.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tmuxp new-window [-n window-name]

.. _Rename window:

Windows can be *renamed after creation*.

=============== =========================================================
Command         .. code-block:: bash

                    $ tmux rename-window <new-name>

Short cut       ``Prefix`` + ``,``
=============== =========================================================

Creating new windows
--------------------

=============== =========================================================
Command         .. code-block:: bash

                    $ tmux new-window [-n window-name]

Short cut       ``Prefix`` + ``c``

                You may then :ref:`Rename window`.
