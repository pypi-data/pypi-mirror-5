Description: ===================
        buildout.disablessl
        ===================
        
        setuptools-0.7 introduced verification of SSL certificates. This feature,
        however, is not configurable (yet?), which makes it impossible to install
        packages from a custom package index with a self-signed certificate, for
        example.
        
        This package is a very small, monkey-patching buildout extension that simply
        sets "ssl avaiable" to false. Use it like so::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.disablessl
        
        
        WARNING: Using this extension disables SSL verification (duh), so you make
        yourself susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks (among other things). Use
        with caution!
