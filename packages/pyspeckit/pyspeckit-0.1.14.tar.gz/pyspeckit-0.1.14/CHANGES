Release 0.1.14 (2013-09-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Bugfix: integral(direct=True) double-subtracted the baseline if it was
              already subtracted
    * New Feature: Models now include analytic integrals (only implemented for
                   Gaussian so far)
    * New Feature: hyperfine models added that allow varying amplitudes & widths

Release 0.1.13 (2013-03-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Cleanup excess data files
    * Bugfixes in baseline fitting
    * Added astropy.models interface

Release 0.1.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * New formaldehyde 218 GHz fitter
    * Allow parinfo to be input as "guess=" or "parinfo="

Release 0.1.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * bugfix to EQW non-fitted ("empirical")

Release 0.1.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * bugfix: unit conversion with reference wavelength
    * bugfix: interactive buttons "reconnected" each time 
    * new feature: voigt profile interactive guess now has 2 widths 

Release 0.1.9 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Added `lineid_plot <http://packages.python.org/lineid_plot/>`_ tools
    * Baseline can fit power laws
    * New TSPEC unmerged, IRAF fits readers
    * astropy.io.fits compatibility fixes

Release 0.1.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * BUGFIX RELEASE
    * Documentation updates
    * Speed boost for model grids
    * Some support for pymodelfit
    * added emcee and pymc generators

Release 0.1.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    * Added cross-correlation 
    * Added (some) unit tests
    * New interactive slider widget for manipulating models (Spectrum.specfit.add_sliders())
    * Subtle but very significant bug-fix: parinfo is now a single uniform
      list, based on the ParinfoList class.
    * You can now fit based on what you see by using the 'use_window_limits=True' kwarg
      .. warning:: This changes the default behavior in interactive mode!
    * lmfit-py can now be used for fitting via the 'use_lmfit' kwarg
    * BUGFIX: SpectroscopicAxis can be converted between units even when scalar
    * velocity frames are read from FITS headers following the VELDEF conventions

Release 0.1.6 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
