Description: PySpecKit Spectroscopic Toolkit
        -------------------------------
        `<pyspeckit.bitbucket.org>`_
        and `<https://github.com/pyspeckit/pyspeckit>`_
        
        This is a code framework designed to allow for analysis of spectroscopic data
        from a wide variety of astronomical instruments.  It is motivated by the lack
        of general spectroscopic analysis tools applicable at multiple wavelengths
        (compare to IRAF, SPLAT, etc. - these are wavelength-specific and/or do not
        make user scripting easy).
        
        Initial implementation focuses on optical and radio applications, e.g.
        gaussian and voigt profile fitting, baseline/continuum fitting, and equivalent
        width measurements.  However, the design is meant to be extensible.  We want
        additional features to be trivial to implement.  
        
        In that vein, there is a growing set of spectral models implemented.  The
        model and hyperfinemodel classes makes
        model implementation quite straightforward, if not trivial (you still have to
        plug in the right frequency offsets and relative line strengths).
        
        Plotting is straightforward, as is usually the case with matplotlib-based
        codes.  We have a few different methods of error bar plotting implemented, a
        decent (and expanding) units class for pretty printing of spectroscopic units,
        and different methods of fit plotting.
        
        We're also looking for more users to give us more use cases!  Contact us
