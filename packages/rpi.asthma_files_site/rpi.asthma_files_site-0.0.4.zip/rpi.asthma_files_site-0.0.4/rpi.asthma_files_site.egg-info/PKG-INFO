        =================
        
        A collective inquiry in to complex conditions. Development sponsored by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).
        
        About
        -----
        
        The "Asthma Files Site" add-on for Plone is a research tool, currently in use by RPI but available to anyone doing similar research. It features Dexterity content types and a Collective Cover integration to enable the creation of an "Asthma File": a collectively developed document containing artifacts and annotations.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install "Asthma Files Site" functionality on your Plone site, add ``rpi.asthma_files_site`` to your list of Plone "instance eggs" in your ``buildout.cfg`` file. Run Buildout and restart Plone. Create a new Plone site with the add-on selected:
        
        .. image:: screenshot1.png
        
        Or add the functionality to an existing site:
        
        .. image:: screenshot2.png
        
        After installation, you should be able to add 6 new content types:

        Usage
        -----
        
        Follow these steps to begin using the "Asthma Files Site" functionality in your Plone site.
        
        Add a Question
        --------------
        
        *Questions* facilitate *Annotations* of *Artifacts* when researchers respond to them in context. Before you do anything else, add an Asthma Question to your site.
        
        .. image:: screenshot4.png
        
        Create Artifacts
        ----------------
        
        An "Asthma File" is produced via the assembly of artifacts and annotations. So next, add some artifacts to your site. E.g.:
        
        Audio artifact
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. Note:: Currently only OGG audio supported
        
        .. image:: screenshot9.png
        
        Document artifact
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Image artifact
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. image:: screenshot5.png
        
        Video artifact
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. Note:: Currenly only OGG video supported
        
        .. image:: screenshot10.png
        
        Create an Asthma File
        ---------------------
        
        Now we can create an Asthma File, which is a collaborative document consisting of multiple Artifacts, Annotations, etc. Made possible via the use of Collective Cover. [1]_
        
        .. image:: screenshot6.png
        
        .. [1] Catch 22: We'd like to customize the available types for Cover, but they don't exist until we install ourselves first. Workaround: customize TTW e.g.
        
        .. image:: screenshot7.png
