#This file is used for system-wide controller configuration. It serves mainly
#to set the default values which will be used when no user configuration is
#found. Users should set their own configuration in the file
# $HOME$/.lnst/lnst-ctl.conf which will be automatically created when it
#doesn't exist.

#The section environment contains generic options mostly related to the
#machine the controller is being run on.

#mac_pool_range is used to specify the range of mac addresses that
#will be used when creating new devices in virtual machines.
#The option accepts two valid mac addresses separated by white spaces.

#The rpcport options specifies the default port we will be connecting to, when
#connecting to slave rpc servers.
#The option accepts a single integer value.

#machine_pool_dirs specifies where the controller should look for specifications
#of machines that can be used for matching templates inside recipes. This
#option accepts a variable number of directory paths separated by white spaces.
#It is also important to note that you can use the operator += to add to the
#list of directories. If the operator = is used, the previous list is replaced.

#test_tool_dirs specifies where the controller looks for custom tools that
#are used in tests. Every tool has it's own subdirectory in one of the
#directories in this list. The option behaves the same way as the option
#machine_pool_dirs, it accepts a list of directory paths and both operators,
# += and = can be used

#test_module_dirs specifies where the controller looks for custom test modules
#the test modules need to be named Test<name>.py otherwise they won't be
#recognized. The behaviour of the option is the same as test_tool_dirs, it
#accepts a list of directory paths and both operators, += and = can be used.

#log_dir option redirects the location of where logs are stored. Every run of
#the application creates its own timestamped subdirectory in the path specified
#in this option. The option accepts one directory path that will be created if
#it doesn't exist. You cannot use the operator += here.
