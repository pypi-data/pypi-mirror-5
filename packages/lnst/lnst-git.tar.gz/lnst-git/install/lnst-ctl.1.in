.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR
.B lnst-ctl
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIRECIPE\fR... \fIACTION\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux Network Stack Test is a tool that supports development and execution
of automated and portable network tests. For detailed description of the
architecture of LNST please refer to project website
(link listed on
.B INTERNET RESOURCES
bellow).

.B lnst-ctl
is a script used for managing slaves. It reads a recipe XML file as an
input and executes tests on the specified slave machines.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cleanup
Cleanup all slave machines berfore executing the recipes.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Toggle emitting debugging messages.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display usage of this command.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-no\-colours
Disable coloured terminal output.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-disable\-pool\-checks
Skip the pool machine availability checks.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-packet\-capture
Capture and log all ongoing network communication between the slaves
during the test.
.TP
.BI "\-x, \-\-result" =file
Write results in XML format to the specified
.IR file .
.PP
.I RECIPE
can be either a LNST recipe file or a directory containing recipe files.
One or more files/directories can be passed at the same time. Each recipe
is a XML file. The format is described in detail in the online documentation
available at LNST wiki (link is listed on
.B INTERNET RESOURCES
bellow).

.I ACTION
can be one from
.BR "run",
.BR "config_only" ", and"
.BR "dump".

When it is set to
.BR "run",
all provided recipe files will be sequentially executed. The network will
be configured accordingly to each recipe file and clean up
afterwards.

In case of
.BR "config_only",
the recipes provided are processed up to the point where all the machines
are prepared and properly configured. No tests will be executed and the
cleanup phase is omitted as well. This mode of operation is useful if you
want to perform some specific actions or tests outside of LNST using
the configuration specified in a recipe file.

At last, when the
.I ACTION
chosen is
.BR "dump",
the network will be configured as specified in the recipe.
.B lnst-ctl
will then dump contents of its internal data structures to the standard
output. This feature can be used for debugging recipes or network setups.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B lnst-ctl
will look for configuration in the following locations:

.I @conf_dir@lnst-ctl.conf
.br
.I ~/.lnst/lnst-ctl.conf

For further description of file format or configuration options available,
please refer to the configuration file itself, where each option is
documented.
