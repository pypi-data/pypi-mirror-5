*spreads* is a tool that aims to streamline your book scanning workflow.
It takes care of every step: Setting up your capturing devices, handling
the capturing process, downloading the images to your machine,
post-processing them and finally assembling a variety of output formats.

Along the way you can always fine-tune the auto-generated results either
by supplying arguments beforehand, or by inspecting the output and
applying your modifications.

*spreads* is meant to be fully customizable. This means, `adding support
for new devices`_ is made as painless as possible. You can also
hook into any of the *spread* commands by imlementing one of the available
`plugin classes`.


Quickstart
----------
*spreads* can be easily installed from PyPi::

    $ pip install spreads

*spreads* offers an interactive wizard that takes you from a physical book
to a digitized version in one single workflow with minimal user input::

    $ spread wizard ~/my_scanning_project

stay tuned!
