==================================
Installing eduCommons $$version$$
==================================

Download the eduCommons $$version$$ release, available at:

::

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/educommons/files/educommons/eduCommons-3.2.1-final/educommons.buildout-3.2.1-final.tar.gz/download



Unarchive the package to a directory which will serve as your buildout directory. Change directories and run the bootstrap script:

::

  cd eduCommons
  /usr/local/python2.4 bootstrap.py
  (in some environments the command will be /usr/local/bin/python2.4 bootstrap.py)


Then run the buildout script to download all the required packages and set up the eduCommons application:

::

	bin/buildout


Or run the same buildout script above, plus the Selenium test runner (needed to run acceptance tests):

::

  bin/buildout -c tests.cfg


Once you have the buildout ready you can launch it using the following:

::

	bin/instance start


Or to launch in the foreground of your console:

::

	bin/instance fg


You should now be able to open a browser and go to the ZMI with the following URL
(assuming that you configured Zope to run on port 8080)

::

	http://<server name>:8080/manage


You should then get a dialog prompt asking for your Zope admin username and password. The default username/password for the buildout is admin/test1234.

Install eduCommons Product in Your Zope Instance
================================================

Once you have logged into the ZMI via the management interface, you are now ready 
to create the site. Start by creating a plone site with the pull down menu in the 
top right corner. Give the plone site an ID and title. The ID will be used in the 
URL to access the site, so name it appropriately. The title will appear several 
places within the eduCommons install, and should be based on your group or institution.</p>
Under "Extension Profiles" you need to do a multi-select (hold down the CTRL or the 
Command key). Select the following so they are all highlighted:

 1. PloneBookmarklets
 2. ContentLicensing
 3. IMSTransport
 4. OpenSearch
 5. OAI Intercom
 6. SearchAndReplace
 7. Zip File Transport
 8. Left Skin
 9. Static Site
10. eduCommons
11. wordpressexchange
12. iw.fss (FileSystemStorage)
13. Working Copy Support (Iterate)
14. CacheSetup
15. LinguaPlone

Then click "Add Plone Site."

If you wish to localize content in other languages you will need to select your supported languages.

In the ZMI:

1. Navigate to your eduCommons instance
2. Navigate to portal_languages
3. Select one or more Allowed languages (use the control or apple key to multi-select)
4. Click Save 

Additional instructions for localizing content using LinguaPlone are available in LOCALIZATION.txt.
Finally, you need to reorder the Layers in your eduCommons Skins Selections.
In the ZMI:

1. Navigate to your eduCommons instance
2. Navigate to portal_skins
3. Click on the Properties tab
4. Under the Skins Selections, in the Layers textbox for LeftSkin, cut the LinguaPlone entry and paste it one a new line below the eduCommons entry 
5. Click Save (be sure to click the Save button for the Skins selection section)
