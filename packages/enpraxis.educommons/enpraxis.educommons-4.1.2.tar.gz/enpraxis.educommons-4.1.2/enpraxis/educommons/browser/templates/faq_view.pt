	the reach of educational opportunity. We support our mission to serve the public

      <h2 i18n:translate="">How does OCW differ from other types of Web-based education?</h2>
      <p i18n:translate="">OCW differs from other Web-based education offerings in that 
	it is free and open, does not provide university credit, and grants no access to 
	university faculty. It is not a distance-learning initiative. The goal is to 
	provide the content and materials that support an education.</p>
