Introduction
------------

The sqlliterals distribution consists of a package containing two different
implementations of SQL statement tokenisation for the detection of literal
regions in such statements. It also provides a function which can replace
one kind of parameter marker with another in statements, subject to the
careful choice of the original parameter marker (since the replacement process
builds on the above tokenisation process and the identification of non-literal
regions).

Examples
--------

See the test.py file for some tests and simple examples which use the parsing/
tokenising and replacement functions.
