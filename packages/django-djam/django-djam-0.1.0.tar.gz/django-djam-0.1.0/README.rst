django-djam
===========

Djam is a third-party admin with the following goals:

* Provide basic CRUD functionality similar to the current admin.
* Ease the transition by supporting auto-generation of an admin based
  on installed ModelAdmins.
* Support most of the basic ModelAdmin options out-of-the-box.
* Make it easy to add new custom areas to the admin that don't fit into the traditional CRUD model.
* Use the latest front-end tools and design patterns.

The name is alliterative; the beginning of Djam is pronounced the same as the beginning of Django.

Djam uses `Font Awesome by Dave Gandy <http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome>`_.
