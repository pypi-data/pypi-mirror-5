Description:       Unified Back End (UBE) is intended as a shippable back end for Python 3 application development.
        
              UBE has a tree-oriented EAV database structure and XML-based database updater functionality to 
        
              create and update that structure and others on Postgres, MySQL, DB2, Oracle and MS SQL Server. 
        
              Many components, like the updater, can be used separately.
         
              The API aims to support CRUD, credentials/rights/permissions and auditing.
         
              Also it uses AOP extensively and therefore provides some usable decorators.
