"Now let us consider another kind of drug – still undiscovered, but probably just around the corner – a drug capable of making people feel happy in 
situations where they would normally feel miserable. Such a drug would be a blessing, but a blessing fraught with grave political dangers. 
By making harmless chemical euphoria freely available, a dictator could reconcile an entire population to a state of affairs to which 
self-respecting human beings ought not to be reconciled. Despots have always found it necessary to supplement force by political or 
religious propaganda. In this sense the pen is mightier than the sword. But mightier than either the pen or the sword is the pill. 
In mental hospitals it has been found that chemical restraint is far more effective than strait jackets or psychiatry. The dictatorships 
of tomorrow will deprive men of their freedom, but will give them in exchange a happiness none the less real, as a subjective experience, 
for being chemically induced. The pursuit of happiness is one of the traditional rights of man; unfortunately, the achievement of happiness may 
turn out to be incompatible with another of man's rights – liberty."
- Aldous Huxley, Drugs That Shape Men's Minds, 1958
