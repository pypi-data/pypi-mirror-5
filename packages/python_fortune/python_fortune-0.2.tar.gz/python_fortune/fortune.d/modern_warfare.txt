"Modern warfare is in every respect so horrifying, that scientific people will only regret that it 
draws its means from the progress of the sciences. I hope that the present war [World War I] will teach 
the peoples of Europe a lasting lesson and bring the friends of peace into power. 
Otherwise the present ruling classes will really deserve to be swept away by socialism." 

-Emil Fischer
