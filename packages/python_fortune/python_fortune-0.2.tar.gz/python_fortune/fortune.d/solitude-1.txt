"What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. 
This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for 
the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. 
It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know
what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live 
after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; 
but the great person is one who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect 
sweetness the independence of solitude."

-- Ralph Waldo Emerson
