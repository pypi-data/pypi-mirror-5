git-flow
========

Pure-Python implementation of Git extensions to provide high-level
repository operations for Vincent Driessen's
`branching model <http://nvie.com/git-model>`_.

We've added a few tweaks to make it cooperate with Pivotal Tracker and ReviewBoard.


Getting started
================

For the best introduction to get started with ``git flow``, please read
Jeff Kreeftmeijer's blog post http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow.

Or have a look at one of these screen casts:

* `How to use a scalable Git branching model called git-flow
  <http://buildamodule.com/video/change-management-and-version-control-deploying-releases-features-and-fixes-with-git-how-to-use-a-scalable-git-branching-model-called-gitflow>`_

Installing salsita-gitflow
====================

You can install ``salsita gitflow``, using::

    easy_install salsita-gitflow

Or, if you'd like to use ``pip`` instead (recommended!)::

    pip install salsita-gitflow

``salsita-gitflow`` requires Python 2.7.

Setting it up
-------------
Global (same for all projects)::

* git config --global reviewboard.url https://dev.salsitasoft.com/rb
* git config --global reviewboard.server https://dev.salsitasoft.com/rb
* git config --global workflow.token <your PT token>

Local (project specific)::

* git config workflow.projectid <PT project id>
* git config reviewboard.repoid <repo id in RB>

If you have the original `git-flow <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>` installed, just go to the git bin folder and delete everything that starts with ``git-flow``.


Integration with your shell
-----------------------------

For those who use the `Bash <http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`_ or
`ZSH <http://www.zsh.org>`_ shell, please check out the excellent work
on the
`git-flow-completion <http://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion>`_
project by `bobthecow <http://github.com/bobthecow>`_. It offers
tab-completion for all git-flow subcommands and branch names.


Please help out
==================

This project is still under development. Feedback and suggestions are
very welcome and I encourage you to use the `Issues list
<http://github.com/htgoebel/gitflow/issues>`_ on Github to provide that
feedback.

Feel free to fork this repo and to commit your additions. For a list
of all contributors, please see the :file:`AUTHORS.txt`.

You will need :module:`unittest2` to run the tests.


License terms
==================

git-flow is published under the liberal terms of the BSD License, see
the :file:`LICENSE.txt`. Although the BSD License does not
require you to share any modifications you make to the source code,
you are very much encouraged and invited to contribute back your
modifications to the community, preferably in a Github fork, of
course.


git flow usage
==================

Initialization
---------------------

To initialize a new repo with the basic branch structure, use::
  
    git flow init [-d]
  
This will then interactively prompt you with some questions on which
branches you would like to use as development and production branches,
and how you would like your prefixes be named. You may simply press
Return on any of those questions to accept the (sane) default
suggestions.

The ``-d`` flag will accept all defaults.

Note: Please use the ``-d`` flag it will make your life much easier.


Creating feature/release/hotfix/support branches
----------------------------------------------------

* To list/start/finish feature branches, use::
  
      git flow feature
      git flow feature start <name> [<base>]
      git flow feature finish <name>
  
  For feature branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``develop``.

  ``feature start`` will list unstarted & started stories from
  current & backlog iterations in Pivotal Tracker. Select one and it's state
  will change to `started`. This command creates a feature branch as well, so
  switch between stories using ``git checkout``, not ``git flow feature start``.

  ``feature finish`` will finish the currently active story (merge it into
  `develop`, push develop, change the story state in PT to `finished` and
  post a review request to Pivotal Tracker). It will do its best to find
  the corersponding review request in ReviewBoard and update the review but
  if it can't then it will post a new review. You can force posting a new
  review by setting the ``-n/--new-review`` flag.

* To push/pull a feature branch to the remote repository, use::

      git flow feature publish <name>
      git flow feature pull <remote> <name>

* To list/start/finish release branches, use::
  
      git flow release
      git flow release start <release> [<base>]
      git flow release finish <release>
  
  For release branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``develop``.
  
* To list/start/finish hotfix branches, use::
  
      git flow hotfix
      git flow hotfix start <release> [<base>]
      git flow hotfix finish <release>
  
  For hotfix branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``master``.

* To list/start support branches, use::
  
      git flow support
      git flow support start <release> <base>
  
  For support branches, the ``<base>`` arg must be a commit on ``master``.


History of the Project
=========================

gitflow was originally developed by Vincent Driessen as a set of
shell-scripts. In Juni 2007 he started a Python rewrite but did not
finish it. In February 2012 Hartmut Goebel started completing the
Python rewrite and asked Vincent to pull his changes. But in June 2012
Vincent closed the pull-request and deleted his ``python-rewrite``
branch. So Hartmut decided to release the Python rewrite on his own.

tool itself remains contributing to the community. If you'd like to
