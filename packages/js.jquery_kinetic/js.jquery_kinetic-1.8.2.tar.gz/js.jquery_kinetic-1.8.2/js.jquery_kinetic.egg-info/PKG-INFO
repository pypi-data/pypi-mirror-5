        *****************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery.kinetic`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of
        jQuery's structure and different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery`: http://jquery.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_kinetic``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``kinetic`` from ``js.jquery_kinetic`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_kinetic import kinetic
          >>> kinetic.need()
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
