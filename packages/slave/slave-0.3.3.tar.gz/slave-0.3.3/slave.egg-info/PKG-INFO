Description: Slave:
        ======
        
        The main goal of slave is to make it easier to communicate with scientific
        instruments. Slave tries to ease the implementation of new instruments and
        comes with a variety of ready-to-use implementations.
        
        A simple measurement script, using `pyvisa`_ for the `GPIB`_ connection,
        might look like::
        
            import time
            import visa
            from slave.sr830 import SR830
        
            # construct and initialize a SR830 instrument with a GPIB connection on 
            # channel 8.
            lockin = SR830(visa.instrument('GPIB::08'))
            lockin.reserve = 'high' # Set the dynamic reserve to `high`.
            lockin.time_constant = 3 # Set the time constant to 3s.
        
            # measure the x value 60 times and wait 1s between each measurement.
            for i in range(60):
                print lockin.x
                time.sleep(1) # delay for 1s.
