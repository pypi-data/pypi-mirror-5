Description: Description
        ===========
        
        The buildout syseggrecipe uses system installed eggs, 
        called syseggs.
        These syseggs are used instead of installing them again during buildout.
        This is usefull for hard to compile eggs or eggs that need specific 
        development libraries.
        
        Example
        ========
        
        An example of how to use the recipe. Please note that the sysegg recipe
        must be the first buildout part.::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = sysegg
          
          [sysegg]
          recipe = syseggrecipe
          eggs =
            netCDF4
        
        To stop the buildout when not all syseggs are installed include: 
        `force-sysegg = True`.::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = sysegg
        
          [sysegg]
          recipe = syseggrecipe
          force-sysegg = true
          eggs =
            netCDF4
        
        Tests
        ======
        
        To test if all syseggs are available while `force-sysegg = true` is 
        enabled in the buildout configuration.:: 
        
          bin/buildout sysegg:force-sysegg=false install sysegg
        
        Origin

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        
        0.2 (2013-09-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix in README for running sysegg standalone.
        
        - Distributions that aren't eggs but directories directly inside a
          ``sys.path`` directory would have the actual system folder as their
          location. This used to mean that everything in that system folder
          can erroneously be used as a system egg. Not anymore, as those
          directories are now symlinked directly instead of being used through
          a too-generic ``.egg-link`` file.
        
        - This recipe uses symlinks for the above fix, which means it doesn't
          work on windows anymore.
        
        
        0.1 (2013-02-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Patch code to allow for force-sysegg=false
        
        - Add original code from osc.recipe.sysegg.
        
        - Add buildout and setup.py.
        
        - Added readme, changes and MIT license.
