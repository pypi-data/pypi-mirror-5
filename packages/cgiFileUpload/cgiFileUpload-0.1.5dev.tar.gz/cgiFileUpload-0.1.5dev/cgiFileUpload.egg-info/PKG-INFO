Description: CGI Image Thumbnailer
        ============================
        
        *Author* Robert Sudwarts
        
        For uploading files via web interface.
        
        Basic scope of the problem
        ---------------------------
        
        Functionality for:
        
          * uploading large files using buffered chunks
          * scaling down large images
          
        
        Package Components
        ---------------------
        
            #. upload.writefile() accepts a FieldStorage instance and writes in
               buffered chunks to the specified directory.
            #. Image files can be written 'as is' or scaled to a specified size and
               [at the same time] as a thumbnail image of a specified size.
            #. A `Thumb` class to check for existence of thumbnail/create/delete etc
        
        
        Change Log
        ------------
        
         * v.0.1.5 when scaling image to thumbnail image is given file extension .jpg 
                   
         * v.0.1.4 added "Pillow>=2.0.0" as a dependency to setup.py.
                   This package is required instead of PIL
        
         * v.0.1.3 added conditional 'scale' to writefile() so that this package can be used for all types of files (not just images)
