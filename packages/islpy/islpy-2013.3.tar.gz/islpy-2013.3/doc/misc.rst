Relation with isl's C interface
===============================

Nearly all of the bindings to isl are auto-generated, using the following
rules:

* Follow :pep:`8`.
* Expose the underlying object-oriented structure.
* Remove the `isl_` and `ISL_` prefixes from data types, macros and
  function names, replace them with Python namespaces.
* A method `isl_printer_print_set` would thus become
  :meth:`islpy.Printer.print_set`.

See also :ref:`gen-remarks`.

User-visible Changes
====================

Version 2013.4
--------------

.. note::

    This version is currently in development and can be obtained from
    islpy's version control.

Version 2011.3
--------------

* Add :meth:`islpy.Set.project_out_except` and friends.
* Add :meth:`islpy.Set.remove_divs_of_dim_type` and friends.
* :class:`islpy.Dim` was renamed to :class:`islpy.Space` in isl.
* :class:`islpy.Div` was removed and replaced by :class:`islpy.Aff`
  wherever it was used previously.
* :meth:`islpy.BasicSet.as_set`
  and
  :meth:`islpy.BasicMap.as_map`
  were removed.
* :ref:`automatic-casts` were added.
* Support for more Python :class:`set`-like behavior was added. In particular,
  the operators `|`, `&', '-', `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` work as expected.
* Support direct construction from string for objects that have a `read_from_str`
  method.
* The constant in a :class:`islpy.Constraint` is now set as the '1'
  key in a coefficient dictionary in
  :meth:`islpy.Constraint.eq_from_names`,
  :meth:`islpy.Constraint.ineq_from_names`, and
  :meth:`islpy.Constraint.set_coefficients_by_name`.

Version 2011.2
--------------

* Switch to copy-by-default semantics.
* A few changes in Python-side functionality.
* Automatic type promotion in 'self' argument.

Version 2011.1
--------------

* Initial release.
