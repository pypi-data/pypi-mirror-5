What is this?
=============

  Expluit0 is a framework for CTF(Capture The Flag). It is used to 
  generate ShellCode, to test ShellCode or to get more things for Exploit. 
  
  It includes modules for many different purposes, including following:
  

Installing
==========

  Instructions for installing this software are in INSTALL.


Unit Tests
==========

  Some of these tests may fail if you
   * blabla
   * run them as root.


Documentation and Support
=========================

  Examples on how to use Expluit0 APIs are located in doc/core/examples;
  this might ease the learning curve a little bit, since all these files
  are kept as short as possible. The file doc/core/howto/index.xhtml
  contains an index of all the core HOWTOs: this should be your starting
  point when looking for documentation.

  Help is available on the Expluit0 mailing list:

    posquit0.bj@gmail.com

  There is no IRC channel.
