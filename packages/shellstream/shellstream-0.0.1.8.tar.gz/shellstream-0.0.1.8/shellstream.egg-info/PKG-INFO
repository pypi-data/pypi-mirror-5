        # What is it?
        
        shellstream is a python client that pipes your terminal IO to the web:
        
        # To Install
        
        ## pip makes it easy
        
            pip install shellstream
        
        # To Run
        
        To run StreamShell, you will need to receive an API Token from [coming soon].  To retrieve a token, first sign up for the service (it's free) and then head to this page [coming soon].
        
        Add this token to your `.bash_profile`:
        
        ```bash
        STREAM_SHELL_TOKEN = [your token]
        ```
        
        # Motivation
        
        When you've got an issue at the command line and need help online, copy and pasting your session on an ongoing basis is a pain and it makes you switch mental context.  So, I created shellstream along with the companion website to make debugging smoother.
        
        
        # Limitations
        
        This initial version is naive.  It is not cross-platform at this point, depending on a number of unix commands. That will come with time.
