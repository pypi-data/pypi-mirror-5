Install Robot-tools
-------------------

[reload]-extras will make ``robot-server`` to detect
filesystem changes under ``./src`` and reload the test layer when a
change is detected.

Update ``buildout.cfg``:

.. code-block:: ini

   [buildout]
   parts =
       ...
       robot

   [robot]
   recipe = zc.recipe.egg
   eggs =
       Pillow
       ${test:eggs}
       plone.app.robotframework[reload]


.. note:: If you added the ``reload``-extras to the
   ``plone.app.robotframework`` egg and there is no ``src`` directory
   in your buildout (such as when you are using the buildout of a specific
   product), robot-server will complain and fail to start.  In this case,
   use the ``-P`` option on the command line to tell it where it should
   watch for changes, e.g.::

       $ bin/robot-server -P <mypath> my.product.testing.MY_PRODUCT_ROBOT_TESTING

.. note:: Technically ``robot-server`` only duplicates some existing
   magic from ``zope.testrunner`` to figure out all the required test
   layers and set them up in the required order.
