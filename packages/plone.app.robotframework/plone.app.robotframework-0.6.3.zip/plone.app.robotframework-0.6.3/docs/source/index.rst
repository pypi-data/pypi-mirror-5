Writing Robot Framework tests for Plone
=======================================

**plone.app.robotframework** provides `Robot Framework
<http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/>`_ compatible tools and resources for
writing functional Selenium tests (including acceptance tests) for Plone CMS
and its add-ons.

**This documentation** gives you everything to get started in writing and
executing functional Selenium tests (including acceptance tests) for Plone or
your own Plone add-on. It depends on two testing frameworks, `Robot Framework
<http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/>`_ and `Selenium
<http://seleniumhq.org/>`_ (with
`Selenium2Library <https://github.com/rtomac/robotframework-selenium2library>`_),
and uses the tools and resources provided by plone.app.robotframework.

Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing
and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), even for behavior driven
development (BDD). It has easy-to-use plain text test syntax and utilizes the
keyword-driven testing approach. Selenium is a web browser automation framework
that exercises the browser as if the user was interacting with the browser.
