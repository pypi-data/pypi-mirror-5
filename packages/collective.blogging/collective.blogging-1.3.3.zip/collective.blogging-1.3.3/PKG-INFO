Description: About
        ============
        
        Yet another blogging tool for Plone. Blogging package provides simple extension for Plone
        to make blogging easier with as little as possible modifications or extra content.
        But still use as much as possible from Plone's default UI to let user's get familiar
        with extra blogging features in a while.
        
        Installing
        ============
        
        This package requires Plone 4.x.
        
        Installing without buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
        directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
        via the setup.py script.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.blogging is even simpler. You can install
        collective.blogging by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
            [instance]
            eggs = collective.blogging
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        So, let's say that in most cases when you want to start simple personal blog,
        default Plone installation without any extra add-ons provides almost all you need.
        For example you can create Folder / Large Plone Folder for blog posts, Smart Folder
        as site frontpage with criteria to search contents of the blog folder and then you
        can start blogging by creating News Items in the blog folder.
        
        Yes that's fine but after while you end up with thinking about better blog view
        template because folder summary view doesn't provide some extra info about listed
        News Items like number of comments, permalink etc.
        
        And that's why the Blogging package was created and hopefully will save your time
        in case you don't need complex blogging tool but still want a blog.
