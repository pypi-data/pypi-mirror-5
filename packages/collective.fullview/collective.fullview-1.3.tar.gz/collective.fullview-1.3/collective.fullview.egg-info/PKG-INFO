Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an alternative full view for Plone with support for
        BrowserViews. BrowserViews weren't fully supported in the skin layer based
        folder_full_view Page Template. This package provides a @@full_view view.
        
        This package fixes: "Error when view folder with folder_full_view view"
