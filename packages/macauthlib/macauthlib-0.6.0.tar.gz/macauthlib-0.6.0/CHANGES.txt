0.6.0 - 2013-06-25
==================

  * Support for requests version 1.0.0 and greater; thanks bobbyrward.
    Unfortunately this is not  backwards-compatible with older versions
    of requests.


0.5.0 - 2012-11-26
==================

  * Support for Python 3, via source-level compatibility.


0.4.0 - 2012-09-31
==================

 * Allow the main API functions to accept a WebOb Request object, a
   requests Request object, or a WSGI environ dict as first argument.
   This should make it easier to implement client programs.
 * macauthlib.sign_request() now returns the Authorization header value, which
   is useful if you pass it something immutable as the request to be signed.
 * Hide functions from macauthlib.utils that were previously available
   directly from macauthlib.  This will ensure users import them from the
   canonical location.


0.3.0 - 2012-07-11
==================

 * Simplify API of the NonceCache class; it now provides a single method
   check_nonce() rather than separate is_fresh() and add_nonce() methods.


0.2.0 - 2012-06-01
==================

 * Fix a race condition bug in NonceCache.


0.1.0 - 2012-02-27
==================

 * Initial release.
