        This package is a django web-app, implementing the calculation of the halo mass function in as general a way as 
        possible while keeping it easy to use. 
        
        This app is not provided as a re-usable app, but rather as an insight into the workings of the current implementation
        at hmf.icrar.org. Feel free to modify it and let me know any bugs.
