Description: django-pygmy
        ============
        
        django-pygmy is a little app that colorizes source codez in your `Django <http://djangoproject.com/>`_ templates. It uses `pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ for prettify the codez and `django-classy-tags <https://github.com/ojii/django-classy-tags>`_ for easy-and-awesome creation of template tags.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install ``django-pygmy``, simply run: ::
        
            pip install django-pygmy
        
        And add the app to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``: ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'django_pygmy',
            )
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Render the awesomeness in your template: ::
        
            {% load pygmy %}
        
            {% pygmy object.code %}
        
        It also takes the same options as `HtmlFormatter <http://pygments.org/docs/formatters/#htmlformatter>`_: ::
        
            {% pygmy object.code nowrap='True' linenos='table' %}
        
        Lexers
        ------
        
        By default ``django-pygmy`` tries to guess which lexer to use based on the code.
        If you wish you can define any lexer of `Pygments lexers <http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/>`_ like so: ::
        
            {% pygmy object.code lexer='python' %}
