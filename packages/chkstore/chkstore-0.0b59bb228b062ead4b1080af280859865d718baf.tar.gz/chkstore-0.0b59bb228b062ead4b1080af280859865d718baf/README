chkstore - A library and commandline tool for Content-Hash-Key storage on a local filesystem.

Content-Hash-Keyed means the lookup key is based on some deterministic
function of the contents.  Ideally this function has the properties of
a cryptographic hash function.  This tool is hardcoded to use sha256.

The file names of completely inserted entries contain this key so that
indexing is performed mostly by the filesystem.

The storage directory is "self-describing" which a _README_ which explains
the storage format, so that backup archaelogists of the future can grok
the contents.

This is a no-networking, no-futuristic-decentralization, little cousin
of freenet, tahoe-lafs, camlistore, and many others, which cherry-picks
their great ideas for a much simpler use case.
