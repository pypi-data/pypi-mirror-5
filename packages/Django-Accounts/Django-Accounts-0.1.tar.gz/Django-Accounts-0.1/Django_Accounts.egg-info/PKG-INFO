Description: Django-Accounts
        ===============
        
        Overview
        --------
        Django-Accounts adds a number of indispensible account-related capabilities to your Django application, including:
        
        * User signup
        
        * Password reset
        
        * Login and logout
        
        * Profile pages
        
        Django-Accounts makes use of class-based views (introduced in Django 1.3) and supports custom user models (introduced in Django 1.5).
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        Django-Accounts was designed with a batteries-included philosophy, so it contains everything (including a full set of templates!) that you need to get up and running right away. 
        
        To install Django-Accounts from PyPI::
        
        	pip install django-accounts
        
        Alternatively, you can also install Django-Accounts from GitHub::
        
        	pip install https://github.com/binarybirchtree/django-accounts/archive/master.zip
        
        Add 'accounts' to your INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py::
        
        	INSTALLED_APPS = (
        		...
        		'accounts',
        		...
        	)
        
        Include the Django-Accounts URLs in your urls.py::
        
        	urlpatterns = patterns(
        		...
        		(r'^accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
        		...
        	)
        
        That's it!
