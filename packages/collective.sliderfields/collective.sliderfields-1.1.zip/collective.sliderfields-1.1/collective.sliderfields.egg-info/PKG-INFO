Description: README for collective.sliderfields
        ===================================
        
        This product simply add a Dexterity Behavior and Archetypes SchemaExtender
        components which provides these 3 fields:
        
        * Slider Image
        * Slider Title
        * Slider Description
        
        It does not do anything more than that. Purpose of this product is to aid in
        development of an easy to use custom slider related addons in Plone without
        having to manage separate contents for slider and its related objects.
        
        All objects with this functionality enabled will have a marker interface
        ISliderFieldsEnabled so that they can be easily queried through catalog (eg: in
        ObjPathSourceBinder queries).
        
        Enabling Behavior
        ------------------
        
        Follow the normal steps for assigning behavior to a Dexterity content type
        
        Enabling SchemaExtender
        -----------------------
        
        Mark the content type with ISliderFieldsEnabled. One method to mark existing
        types is to use ZCML::
        
            <class class="Products.ATContentTypes.content.link.ATLink">
               <implements interface="collective.sliderfields.interfaces.ISliderFieldsEnabled"/>
            </class>
