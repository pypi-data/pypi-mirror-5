Introduction
============

ATpy is a high-level package providing a way to manipulate tables of
astronomical data in a uniform way.

Documentation is available from [http://atpy.readthedocs.org/]

ATpy is released under an MIT open-source license

Please Note
===========

Much of ATpyâ€™s functionality has now been incorporated into
(Astropy)[http://www.astropy.org], and while we will continue to fix bugs, we
are no longer actively developing new features in ATpy, instead focusing our
efforts on Astropy. If you are a new user, and do not need the SQL-querying
functionality, we recommend using (Astropy
Tables)[http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/] directly.
