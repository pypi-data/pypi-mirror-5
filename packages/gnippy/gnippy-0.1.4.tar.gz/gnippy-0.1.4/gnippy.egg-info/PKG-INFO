Description: gnippy: GNIP + Python
        =====================
        
        gnippy provides an easy way to access the `Power Track <http://gnip.com/twitter/power-track/>`_ stream provided by GNIP.
        
        Installation:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            pip install gnippy
        
        Usage:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            import time
            from gnippy import PowerTrackClient
        
            # Define a callback
            def callback(activity):
                print activity
        
            # Create the client
            url = "http://my.gnip.powertrack/url.json"
            auth = ('MyUserName', 'MyPassword')
            client = PowerTrackClient(url, auth, callback)
            client.connect()
            
            # Wait for 2 minutes and then disconnect
            time.sleep(120)
            client.disconnect()
        
        That's it!
