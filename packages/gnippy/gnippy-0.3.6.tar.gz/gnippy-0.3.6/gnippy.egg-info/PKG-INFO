        gnippy provides an easy way to access the `Power Track <http://gnip.com/twitter/power-track/>`_ stream provided by GNIP.
        You can also use gnippy to programatically add rules to your Power Track stream.
        
        Install
        -------
        .. code-block:: python
        
            pip install gnippy
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        Create a .gnippy file and place it in your home directory. It should contain the following:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
            [Credentials]
            username = user@company.com
            password = mypassword
        
            [PowerTrack]
            url = https://my.gnip.powertrack/url.json
        
        Fire up the client:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            import time
            from gnippy import PowerTrackClient
        
            # Define a callback
            def callback(activity):
                print activity
        
            # Create the client
            client = PowerTrackClient(callback)
            client.connect()
            
            # Wait for 2 minutes and then disconnect
            time.sleep(120)
            client.disconnect()
        
        If you don't want to create a config file or you want it put it in another location:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            client = PowerTrackClient(callback, config_file_path="/etc/gnippy")
            # OR ... provide the url and authentication credentials to override any config files
            client = PowerTrackClient(callback, url="http://my.gnip.powertrack/url.json", auth=("uname", "pwd"))
        
        Adding PowerTrack Rules
        -----------------------
        
        If you want to add `rules <http://support.gnip.com/customer/portal/articles/477713-rules-methods-documentation>`_ to your PowerTrack:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from gnippy import rules
            from gnippy.errors import RuleAddFailedException
        
            # Synchronously add rules
            try:
                rules.add_rule('(Hello OR World OR "this is a test") AND lang:en', tag="MyRule")
                rules.add_rule('Rule without a tag')
            except RuleAddFailedException:
                pass # uh oh
        
            # OR ... synchronously add multiple rules at once
            rule_list = []
            rule_list.append(rules.build("Hello World", tag="asdf"))
            rule_list.append(rules.build("Rule Without a Tag"))
            try:
                rules.add_rules(rule_list)
            except RuleAddFailedException:
                pass # uh oh
        
            # OR ... manually pass in params - overrides any config files
            rules.add_rule("My Rule String", tag="mytag", url="http://my.gnip.powertrack/url.json", \
                           auth=("uname", "pwd"))
        
        
        Listing Active PowerTrack Rules
        -------------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          from gnippy import rules
          from gnippy.errors import RulesGetFailedException
        
          try:
              rules_list = rules.get_rules()
              # rules_list is in the format:
              # [
              #    { "value": "(Hello OR World) AND lang:en" },
              #    { "value": "Hello", "tag": "mytag" }
              # ]
          except RulesGetFailedException:
              pass # uh oh
        
        Deleting PowerTrack Rules
        -------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from gnippy import rules
            from gnippy.errors import RuleDeleteFailedException, RulesGetFailedException
        
            try:
                rules_list = rules.get_rules()
                # Suppose I want to delete the first rule in the list
                rules.delete_rule(rules_list[0])
                # OR ... I want to delete ALL rules
                rules.delete_rules(rules_list)
        
            except RuleDeleteFailedException, RulesGetFailedException:
                pass # uh oh
