Description: SoftLayer API Python Client
        ===========================
        SoftLayer API bindings for Python. For use with 
        [SoftLayer's API](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/softlayerapi). For more 
        documentation, [go here](http://softlayer.github.com/softlayer-api-python-client/).
        
        This library provides a simple interface to interact with SoftLayer's XML-RPC
        API and provides support for many of SoftLayer API's features like
        [object masks](http://sldn.softlayer.com/article/Using-Object-Masks-SoftLayerAPI). 
        It also contains a command-line interface that can be used to access various 
        SoftLayer services using the API.
