Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        When you install a new visual editor in your Plone 3 Site, you can set
        ``wysiwyg_editor`` in portal_memberdata to the proper value for this
        new editor.  This only means that *new* users will get this new editor.
        To change the editor for all existing users, use this package.
        
        In Plone 4 this should be less necessary, because this Plone version
        introduces an option for members to simply use whatever the current
        default editor of the site is.  If you migrate from Plone 3 you can
        still use this package to change all members so they use this option.
        
        This package makes available a browser view ``@@set-default-editor``
        to change the editor setting of members.  Follow the instructions
        there.  This has slightly different functionality for Plone 3 and
        Plone 4.  You can choose to run this in dry-run mode and see how many
        users would be changed.  When dry run is not selected, details are
        logged to the instance log.
        
        On the same form you can also select to set the default editor for
        new users (Plone 3) or set the editor that is used when 'Use site
        default' is selected (Plone 4).

        I (Maurits van Rees) found the main code in an article_ by Rob
        Gietema.  He apparently got the script from Kelly Craig.  And I have
        seen the same code in a post_ to the plone-setup list by Reinout van
        Rees.  So I claim it back in defense of our family honour. ;-)

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.5 (2013-09-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Split the form in two for clarity: one for setting the default
          editor that is used when the member has not set a preference and one
          for setting the editor in the preferences of each existing user.
          [maurits]
        
        - When first loading the form, select the site default editor or the
          default member editor.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.4 (2012-11-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Be smarter about getting all users, also when many_users is true and
          you are using ldap.
          [maurits]
        
        - Use the default_editor site property when it is there (Plone 4).
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.3 (2012-10-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Avoid hard dependency on zope.app.component, to gain Plone 4.3
          compatibility.
          [maurits]
        
        - Make compatible with Plone 4.1+ (load CMFCore zcml for the
          permissions).
          [maurits]
        
        - Code moved to https://github.com/zestsoftware/collective.setdefaulteditor
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.2 (2010-04-27)
        ----------------
        
        - When there are many users (site_properties/many_users) try to get
          all members by searching for a login with 'a', then 'b', etc.  Not
          ideal, but if for example LDAP gives problems because it returns too
          many results (which means it does not actually return anything) then
          this may help.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.1 (2010-04-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Also offer option to set the chosen editor as new default in
          portal_memberdata.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added form to make setting the editor more user friendly.
          [maurits]
        
        - Check that the input for the wanted editor is sane: is that editor
          actually installed?
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2010-03-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release
