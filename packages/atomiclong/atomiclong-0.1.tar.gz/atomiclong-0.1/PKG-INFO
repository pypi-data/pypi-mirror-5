Description: AtomicLong
        ==========
        
        Sometimes you need to increment some numbers
        … atomically
        … in python.
        
        
        ``AtomicLong`` was born out of the need for fast thread-safe counters in python.
        
        Example::
        
            >>> from atomiclong import AtomicLong
            >>> a = AtomicLong(0)
            >>> a += 1
            >>> a.value
            1
            >>> a += 10
            >>> a.value
            11
            >>> a.value = 1000
            >>> a.value
            1000
            >>> a.value -= 100
            >>> a.value
            900
