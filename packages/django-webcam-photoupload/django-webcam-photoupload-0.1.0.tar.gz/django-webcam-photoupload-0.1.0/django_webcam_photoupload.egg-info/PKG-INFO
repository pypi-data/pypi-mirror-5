Description: ===========
        Webcam Photo Upload
        ===========
        
        Written mostly by Mike Vattuone at Citizen Engagement Laboratory, with support from Josh Levinger.
        
        This webcam photo upload tool provides a tool for people to upload a picture of themselves, just as they are reading and learning about your campaign, and share their support or opposition to a cause or person.  
        
        Installation
        =========
        
        Pretty dang simple:
        
        * Add 'photo_upload' to your INSTALLED_APPS.
        
        * Include photo_upload.urls in your main URL.
        
        * ...?  Not really sure what you'll have to do to make this work nicely, quite yet... 
        
        A caveat
        -------------
        
        Sooo we're still kind of figuring out how to organize this bad boy, so any and all suggestions to the structure of the project would be more than welcome.  :)
