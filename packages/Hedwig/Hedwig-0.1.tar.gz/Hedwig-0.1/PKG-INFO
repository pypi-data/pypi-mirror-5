        ======
        
        django.core.mail provides a nice interface to sending/testing email via various
        backends including SMTP. Unfortunately, it's distributed under django project.
        
        This, Hedwig, is a copy of django.core.mail. All interfaces will be
        compatible with django.core.mail, but implemenation could be different.
        
Platform: any
