Tutorial
---------

`There is a small tutorial about how to use django-bitcoin to create your own instawallet <http://blog.kangasbros.fi/?p=85>`_.

Wallet websites, escrow services using the "Wallet"-model
------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the `Wallet` class to do different bitcoin-moving applications. Typical example would be a marketplace-style site, where there are multiple sellers and buyer. Or job freelance site, where escrow is needed. Or even an exchange could be done with this abstraction (a little extra classes would be needed however).

Note that while you move bitcoins between Wallet-objects, only bitcoin transactions needed are incoming and outgoing transactions.
Transactions between the system "Wallet"-objects don't generate "real" bitcoin transactions. Every transaction (except incoming transactions) is logged to `WalletTransaction` object to ease accounting.

This also means that outgoing bitcoin transactions are "mixed"::


    from django_bitcoin import Wallet, currency

    class Profile(models.Model):
        wallet = ForeignKey(Wallet)
        outgoing_bitcoin_address = CharField()

    class Escrow(models.Model):
        wallet = ForeignKey(Wallet)
        buyer_happy = BooleanField(default=False)

    buyer=Profile.objects.create()
    seller=Profile.objects.create()

    purchase=Escrow.objects.create()

    AMOUNT_USD="9.99"

    m=currency.Money(AMOUNT_USD, "USD")
    btc_amount=currency.exchange(m, "BTC")

    print "Send "+str(btc_amount)+" BTC to address "+buyer.wallet.receiving_address()

    sleep(5000) # wait for transaction

    if p1.wallet.total_balance()>=btc_amount:
        p1.send_to_wallet(purchase, btc_amount)

        sleep(1000) # wait for product/service delivery

        if purchase.buyer_happy:
            purchase.wallet.send_to_wallet(seller.wallet)
            seller.wallet.send_to_address(seller.outgoing_bitcoin_address, seller.wallet.total_balance())
        else:
            print "WHY U NO HAPPY"
            #return bitcoins to buyer, 50/50 split or something

Templatetags
----------------

To display transaction history and simple wallet tagline in your views, use the following templatetags::

    {% load currency_conversions %}
    <!-- display balance tagline, estimate in USD and received/sent -->
    {% wallet_tagline profile.bitcoin_wallet %}
    <!-- display list of transactions as a table -->
    {% wallet_history profile.bitcoin_wallet %}

Easy way to convert currencies from each other: `btc2usd, usd2btc, eur2btc, btc2eur`

Also currency2btc, btc2currency for any currencies on bitcoincharts.com::

    {% load currency_conversions %}
    Hi, for the pizza: send me {{bitcoin_amount}}BTC (about {{ bitcoin_amount|btc2usd }}USD).

Display QR code of the bitcoin payment using google charts API::

    {% load currency_conversions %}
    Pay the following payment with your android bitcoin wallet:
    {% bitcoin_payment_qr wallet.receiving_address bitcoin_amount %}.

    The same but display also description and an estimate in EUR:
    {% bitcoin_payment_qr wallet.receiving_address bitcoin_amount "One beer" "EUR" %}.

Transaction notifications
-----------------------------

To enable bitcoin transaction notifications, set the following flag in your ``settings.py``::

    BITCOIN_TRANSACTION_SIGNALING = True

After that, you need to setup a *cron* job to run each minute, something like the following::


    * * * * * (cd $APP_PATH && python manage.py python manage.py CheckTransactions >> $APP_PATH/logs/email_sends.log 2>&1)


After that you can define your balance_changed and balance_changed_confirmed signals::

    from django_bitcoin.models import balance_changed, balance_changed_confirmed
    from django.dispatch import receiver


    @receiver(balance_changed)
    def balance_changed_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        pass
        # try:
        # print "balance changed", sender.id, kwargs["changed"], sender.total_balance()


    @receiver(balance_changed_confirmed)
    def balance_changed_confirmed_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        pass
