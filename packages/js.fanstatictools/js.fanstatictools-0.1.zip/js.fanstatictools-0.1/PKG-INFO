        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library provides some javascript helpers for use with `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        
        
        Get URLs of resources from within Javascript
        ============================================
        
        When you need to load other (fanstatic) resources inside your javascript, you
        may want to calculate the URL to the fanstatic library the resource is defined
        in. Using relative URLs does not work, because they are calculated relative to
        the windows URL, not to the URL of the current script, which can be different.
        
        After including the js.fanstatictools.lib_url fanstatic resource, you are able
        to call fanstatictools.get_library_url('name_of_your_library'), which returns
        the url. Add the filename of the resource to the end and you are done.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``url`` from ``js.fanstatictools`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.fanstatictools import lib_url
          >>> lib_url.need()
