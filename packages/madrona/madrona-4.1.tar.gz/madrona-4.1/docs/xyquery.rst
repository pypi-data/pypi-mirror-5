``madrona.xyquery`` - Fast raster point query
=============================================

``xyqyery`` allows you to load up rasters and ask the simple question - "What is the value of all raster datasets at this given coordinate". A precursor to the ``raster_stats`` app, this can be a fast alternative if your raster queries are point based.
