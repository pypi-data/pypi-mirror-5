MLPA Madrona Apps
=================================

Several apps were created for MarineMap 2.0 on the north coast of California in support of the Marine Life Protection Act.
These apps are no longer supported but can be ported to the madrona platform with minimal effort::

    bioregions
    bioeconomic_model
    depth_range
    geographic_report
    intersection
    pg_spacing
    replication
    straightline_spacing
    spacing

They are still available at http://code.google.com/p/marinemap/ and http://code.google.com/p/northcoast-marinemap/
