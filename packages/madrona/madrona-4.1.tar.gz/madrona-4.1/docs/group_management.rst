``madrona.group_management`` - Manage group membership
======================================================

This app contains some simple components aimed at allowing user's to manage their own group membership. By default, a user's group membership is determined only by administrative users. In some cases, the administrator may want this level of control. In other cases you may want the users to self-organize - that is where the group_management app can help.
