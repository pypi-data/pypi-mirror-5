The Zen of Madrona

The best decision-making process will vary by geography and culture.
Work directly with the intended users to capture the mental model of your decision-making process.
Let the mental model define which features are needed.
The Features will then define the API.
The API and its workspace document will drive the client interface.
Let these conventions be your guide but they should get out of the way when no longer useful."""
