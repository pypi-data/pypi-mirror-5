        *****************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `log4javascript`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`log4javascript`: http://log4javascript.org/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.log4javascript``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``log4javascript`` from ``js.log4javascript`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.log4javascript import log4javascript
          >>> log4javascript.need()
