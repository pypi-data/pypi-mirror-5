js.log4javascript
*****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `log4javascript`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`log4javascript`: http://log4javascript.org/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.log4javascript``) are published to some URL.
