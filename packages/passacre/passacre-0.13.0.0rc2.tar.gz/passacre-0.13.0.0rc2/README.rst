passacre = password massacre (i.e. what happens when you use the same password
on every site)

hi!!

I really love supergenpass, but the implementation leaves some things to be
desired. feverish (and possibly delirious), I hacked up a little
proof-of-concept thing.

the gist of it is that passacre uses the Keccak sponge function to repeatably
derive a value from your master password and a site name, and then encodes that
value using a password schema (since different sites have different (and
terrible) password requirements).

also, it's ISC-licensed!

every user-facing part of this sucks right now, but it's a work-in-progress.

docs coming soon!!

here's how to use it for now::

  # for keccak generation
  pip install 'passacre[cli,keccak_generation]'
  # for skein generation (python 3 only)
  pip install 'passacre[cli,skein_generation]'
  # to be able to copy passwords, add the 'clipboard' variant too:
  pip install 'passacre[cli,clipboard,keccak_generation]'
  # then finally:
  passacre init
