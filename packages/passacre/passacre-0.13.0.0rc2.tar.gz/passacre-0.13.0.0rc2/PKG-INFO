Description: passacre = password massacre (i.e. what happens when you use the same password
        on every site)
        
        hi!!
        
        I really love supergenpass, but the implementation leaves some things to be
        desired. feverish (and possibly delirious), I hacked up a little
        proof-of-concept thing.
        
        the gist of it is that passacre uses the Keccak sponge function to repeatably
        derive a value from your master password and a site name, and then encodes that
        value using a password schema (since different sites have different (and
        terrible) password requirements).
        
        also, it's ISC-licensed!
        
        every user-facing part of this sucks right now, but it's a work-in-progress.
        
        docs coming soon!!
        
        here's how to use it for now::
        
          # for keccak generation
          pip install 'passacre[cli,keccak_generation]'
          # for skein generation (python 3 only)
          pip install 'passacre[cli,skein_generation]'
          # to be able to copy passwords, add the 'clipboard' variant too:
          pip install 'passacre[cli,clipboard,keccak_generation]'
          # then finally:
          passacre init
