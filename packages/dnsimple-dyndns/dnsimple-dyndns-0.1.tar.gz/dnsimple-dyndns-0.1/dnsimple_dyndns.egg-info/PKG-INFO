Description: dnsimple-dyndns
        ===============
        
        Dynamic DNS implementation, that relies on DNSimple.com
        
        This is a simple script that updates (and creates, if needed) an ``A`` domain record for any
        ``DNSimple.com`` managed domain. It is designed to be run as a hook script right after the
        WAN connection.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```
        usage: dnsimple-dyndns [-h] [-v] [-t TTL] [-i IP]
                               DOMAIN DOMAIN-TOKEN RECORD-NAME
        
        Dynamic DNS implementation, that relies on DNSimple.com.
        
        positional arguments:
          DOMAIN             domain controlled by DNSimple.com
          DOMAIN-TOKEN       DNSimple.com domain API key.
          RECORD-NAME        name of the record to be updated.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help         show this help message and exit
          -v, --version      show program's version number and exit
          -t TTL, --ttl TTL  DNS record TTL, defaults to 60
          -i IP, --ip IP     IP address, defaults to current external address from
                             http://icanhazip.com/
        ```
        
        
        Running on Gentoo with OpenRC
        -----------------------------
        
        To run this script on Gentoo with OpenRC, you should emerge the ``dnsimple-dyndns`` package:
        
        ```
        # emerge -av dnsimple-dyndns
        ```
        
        Then add the following function to your ``/etc/conf.d/net`` file (or edit your postup function,
        if already exists):
        
        ```bash
        postup() {
            if [[ "${IFACE}" = "enp3s0" ]]; then
                einfo "Updated DNS record: $(dnsimple-dyndns example.com your-domain-token home)"
            else
                einfo "Ignoring interface: ${IFACE}"
            fi
        }
        ```
        
        Replace ``enp3s0`` with your WAN interface, ``example.com`` with your DNSimple.com managed domain,
        ``your-domain-token`` with your DNSimple.com domain token
        (see http://developer.dnsimple.com/authentication/#dnsimple-domain-token) and ``home`` with your
        desired DNS record name.
