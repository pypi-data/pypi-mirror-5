Description: TDTPy is a Python wrapper around `Tucker-Davis Technologies`_ `ActiveX library`_
        [PDF link] (known as RPcoX) for communicating with their System 3 hardware (e.g.
        the RP2.1, RX6, RZ6, etc.).  In addition to the standard operations (loading
        circuits, configuring tags and reading/writing to hardware buffers), TDTPy
        offers a number of high-level features that are not included in the ActiveX
        library:
        
        * Handling type conversion between analog and digital units (e.g. converting
          seconds to number of DSP cycles based on the CPU frequency of the hardware).
        * Remote procedure call (RPC) server for allowing multiple processes and/or programs
          to communicate with the hardware across the same connection.  The drivers
          provided by TDT do not handle concurrency issues.  To handle these issues, we
          have created a RPC server that handles concurrency issues, allowing multiple
          programs to talk to the hardware simultaneously.  The programs can either run
          on the same computer or on a separate computer.
        * If you use the RPC server, your client code can run on any platform (e.g. Mac
          OSX, Unix, Solaris, etc); however, the server must run on a Windows-based
          computer.
        * Simple reads and writes.  The hardware buffers are implemented as "ring
          buffers" with various features such as multichannel storage and data
          compression.  TDTPy automatically detects the configuration of the hardware
          buffer and returns a buffer object (`DSPBuffer`) that you can read/write
          to without having to deal with the intricacies of the hardware buffer itself.
        * Robust error handling.  Some methods in the ActiveX library will fail silently
          (e.g. if you try to access a nonexistent tag, attempt to write more data than
          the hardware buffer can hold, or wire up a tag to a static port).  When the
          RPvds circuit is first loaded to the hardware, TDTPy will inspect the
          microcode (i.e. the RPvds circuit) and store some information about the tags
          and buffers available.  All subsequent operations are validated against this
          metadata before being passed to the ActiveX library.  If an invalid operation
          is attempted, a DSPError is raised with the appropriate message.
