.TH org.debian.apt.transaction 7 "December 2009" "aptdaemon" "D-Bus Interface"
.SH NAME
org.debian.apt.transaction \- the main interface of an aptdaemon transaction
.SH SYNOPSIS
Each transaction is represented as an unique D-Bus object, e.g. at the D-Bus path
.IR /or/debian/apt/transaction/12123-123-123213 .
Which provides the following interface.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS METHODS
.TP
.B ProvideMedium
.BI "ProvideMedium\t(in 's' " medium )
.RS
.PP
Continue a paused transaction which is waiting for the given
.IR medium .
.PP
If a media change is required to e.g. install packages from a CD/DVD
the transaction will be paused and the RequiredMedium property changed
to an array of the 
.IR "medium label" " and its " "mount point" .
Furthermore the MediumRequired signal will be emitted.
.RE
.TP
.B ResolveConfigFileConflict
.BI "ResolveConfigFilePrompt\t(in 's' " config ,
.br 
.BI "\t\t\t\tin 's' " answer )
.RS
.PP
Continue a paused transaction which is waiting for an answer to handle
a configuration file conflict.
.I Config
is the path to the current configuration file and 
.I answer
can be either "replace" or "keep".
.PP
If a later config file is shipped in a package which overrides some
user modifications the transaction will be paused and the ConfigFileConflict
property of the transaction will be set to an array of the old and new
configuration file path. The later one is supposed to replace the former one.
Furthermore the ConfigFileConflict signal will be emitted.
.RE
.TP
.B Simulate
.BI "Simulate\t()" 
.RS
.PP
Simulate the transaction and calculate dependencies, required disk space and
download size. If a transaction would fail the corresponding error will be
raised.
.RE
.TP
.B Run
.BI "Run\t()" 
.RS
.PP
Queue the transaction for processing. Afterwards there cannot be made any further changes to the transaction, e.g. modifing the http proxy.
.RE
.TP
.B Cancel
.BI "Cancel\t()" 
.RS
.PP
Cancel the transaction if possible.
.RE
.SS SIGNALS
.TP
.B Finished
.BI "Finished\t('s' " exit_state )
.RS
.PP
The signal will be emitted when the transaction has been processed. The 
.I exit_state
indicates if the transaction was completed, cancelled or failed.
.RE
.TP
.B MediumRequired
.BI "MediumRequired\t('s' " label ,
.br
.BI "\t\t\t's' " mount_point )
.RS
.PP
The signal will be emitted if the transaction has been paused and waits for a media change to install packages.
.RE
.TP
.B ConfigFileConflict
.BI "ConfigFileConflict\t('s' " old ,
.br
.BI "\t\t\t's' " new )
.RS
.PP
The signal will be emitted if the transaction has been paused because a 
.I new
configuration file is shipped in a package which would override changes by the
user in the
.I old
configuration file.
.RE
.TP
.B PropertyChanged
.BI PropertyChanged\t('s' " property_name ,
.br
.BI "\t\t\t'v' " value  )
.RS
.PP
The signal will be emitted if one of the following properties has changed.
