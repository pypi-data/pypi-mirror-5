The D-Bus API of the aptdaemon
==============================

Aptdaemon provides two D-Bus interfaces on the system bus.

org.debian.apt --- The aptdaemon interface
------------------------------------------

This is the main interface which allows you to perform package managing tasks. 
It is proivded by the aptdaemon object at ``/org/debian/apt``. 

There are two kind of tasks: ones which are performed immediately and ones 
which are queued up in transaction and performed in a sequence.

Non-transaction based methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.GetTrustedVendorKeys() -> array(string)

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.Quit()


Transaction based methos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of performing the task immediately, a new transaction will be created
and the method will return the D-Bus path of it. Afterwards you can simulate
the transaction or put it on the queue.

:ref:`life_cycle` and :ref:`chaining` are described in the Python client
documentation with code examples.

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.UpdateCache() -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.UpdateCachePartially(sources_list : string) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.AddRepository(src_type : string, uri : string, dist : string, comps : array(string), comment : string, sourcesfile : string) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.EnableDistroComponent(component : string) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.InstallFile(path : string, force : boolean) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.InstallPackages(package_names : array(string)) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.RemovePackages(package_names : array(string)) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.UpgradePackages(package_names : array(string)) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.CommitPackages(install : array(string), reinstall : array(string), remove : array(string), purge : array(string), upgrade : array(string), downgrade : array(string)) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.UpgradeSystem(safe_mode : boolean) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.FixIncompleteInstall() -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.FixBrokenDepends() -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.AddVendorKeyFromKeyserver(keyid : string, keyserver : string) -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.AddVendorKeyFromFile(path : string) -> string


Signals
^^^^^^^

The following singal can be emitted on the org.debian.apt interface.

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.AptDaemon.ActiveTransactionsChanged(current : string, queued : array(string))

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

The daemon interface provides a set of properties which can be accessed and modified through :meth:`Set()`, :meth:`Get()` and :meth:`GetAll()` methods of the ``org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties`` interface.
See the `D-Bus specification <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-properties>`_ for more details.

The following properties are available:

.. attribute:: AutoCleanInterval : i

    The interval in days in which the cache of downloaded packages should
    should be cleaned. A value of 0 disables this feature.

    *writable*


.. attribute:: AutoDownload : b

    If available upgrades should be already downloaded in the background.
    The upgrades won't get installed automatically.

    *writable*

.. attribute:: AutoUpdateInterval : i
   
    The interval in days in which the software repositories should be checked
    for updates. A value of 0 disables the automatic check.

    *writable*

.. attribute:: PopConParticipation : b

    If statistics about installed software and how often it is used should be
    sent to the distribution anonymously. This helps to determine which
    software should be shipped on the first install CDROMs and to make software
    recommendations.

    *writable*

.. attribute:: UnattendedUpgrade : i

    The interval in days in which updates should be installed
    automatically. A value of 0 disables this feature.

    *writable*

.. attribute:: RebootRequired : b

   Set if a reboot is required in order to complete the update.

    *readonly*


org.debian.apt.transaction --- The transaction interface
--------------------------------------------------------

This is the main interface of a transaction object. It allows to control and
monitor the transaction. Transactions are created by using the org.debian.apt
interface of aptdaemon.

The path of a transaction object consists of ``/org/debian/apt/transaction/`` and an unique identifier.

Methods
^^^^^^^

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.Run()

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.RunAfter(tid : string)

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.Cancel()

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.Simulate()

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.ProvideMedium(medium : string)

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.ResolveConfigFileConflict(config : string, answer : string)

Signals
^^^^^^^

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.Finished() -> string

.. automethod:: aptdaemon.core.Transaction.PropertyChanged() -> string, variant

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

The transaction interface provides a set of properties which can be accessed and modified through :meth:`Set()`, :meth:`Get()` and :meth:`GetAll()` methods of the ``org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties`` interface.
See the `D-Bus specification <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-properties>`_ for more details.

For the documentation of the available string enumerations, see :mod:`aptdaemon.enums`.

The following properties are available:


.. attribute:: AllowUnauthenticated : b

    If it is allowed to install not authenticated packages by the transaction.
    Defaults to False.

    *writable*

.. attribute:: Cancellable : b

    If the transaction can be cancelled at the moment.

    *read-only*

.. attribute:: ConfigFileConflict : (ss)

    If the transaction waits for the resolution of a configuration file
    conflict, this property contains an array of the path to the old and
    the path to the new configuration file. See
    :meth:`ResolveConfigFileConflict()`.

    *read-only*
 
.. attribute:: DebconfSocket : s

    The path to the socket which should be used to proxy debconf communication
    to the user.

    * array of the packages to not upgrade (keep)

    The packages are specified by their name and a version number
    separated by an "=", e.g. "xterm=261-1".
    The dependencies are calculated after :meth:`Simulate()` or :meth:`Run()`
    was called.

    *read-only*

.. attribute:: Download : x

    The required download size in Bytes.

    The property is available after :meth:`Simulate()` or :meth:`Run()` has
    been called.

    *read-only*

.. attribute:: Error : (ss)

    If the transaction failed this property contains an array of the error
    code, e.g. ``error-no-lock`` and a detailed error message.

    *read-only*

.. attribute:: ExitState : s

    If the transaction is completed it contains the exit status enum of
    the transaction, e.g. ``exit-failed``. If the transaction has not yet
    been completed it is ``exit-unfinished``.

    corresponding to the transaction.

    If a dict is written to the property it will be merged with the existing
    one. It is not allowed to override already existing keys.

    *writable*

    authenticated repository.

    *read-only*


.. _policykit:

PolicyKit privileges
--------------------

Most actions require the user to authenticate. The PolicyKit
framework is used by aptdaemon for the authentication process.
This allows to run aptdaemon as root and the client application as normal user.

For non-transaction based actions the authentication will happen immediately. 
For transaction based actions the privilege will be checked after :meth:`Run()`
has been called. If the privilege has not yet been granted the user will
be requested to authenticate interactively. 
This allows the user to simulate a transaction before having to
authenticate.

Aptdaemon supports so called high level privileges which allow to perform
a specified set of actions in a row without having to authenticate for each
one separately. This only works if the client application authenticates for 
the high level privilge before running the transactions and the authentication
is cached.

There are two high level privileges ``install-packages-from-new-repo`` and
``install-purchased-software``. Both allow to add a repository, install the
key of vendor from a keyserver, update the cache and to install packages.
