  Data Import Configuration

  This will load all your existing ticket and wiki data into the solr index.
  If you use a database other then mysql you may need to change the queries
  slightly. You will likely have to change the connection url as well.

  To start this data import hit the following url (assumes solr is running
  on the default port on localhost):
  http://localhost:8983/solr/dataimport?command=full-import

  For more details see:
