Description: TarMan
        ======
        
        
        This is archive manager with curses interface.
        Have you ever wanted to create an archive quickly without
        using help pages in the process for all the command line switches?
        Well here comes the tarman, it has only two command line options:
        
            * --help or
            * path to archive or directory
        
        
        At first it was meant to be only for tar archives (hence the name),
        but support for other archives does not hurt. 
        Dependencies are:
        
            * libarchive
            * Python 2.7 (or Python 2.6)
        
        
        It supports archives that are manageable with libarchive.
        
        For now it supports:
        
            * file browser
            * one-level browsing of supported archives
            * extraction of files
            * create archive option
