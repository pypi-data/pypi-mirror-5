devflow
========

devflow is a set of Python tools to manage versions, help implement the git
flow development process, and build Python and Debian packages. Although it has
been developed primarily for use with Synnefo, other projects may find it
useful too.

Quickstart
==========

import os

from devflow.version import get_python_version
os.environ["DEVFLOW_BUILD_MODE"] = "snapshot"
print "This commit's Python version is", get_python_version()

or take a look at devflow's own setup.py for ideas.
