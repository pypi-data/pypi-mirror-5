Package containing the higher level instrument control classes. Theses classes
assume that the lower-level drivers are IVI-compliant and provide user-
friendly functionalities like Graphical User Interfaces.

Defining one's own instrument wrapper is rather simple. Just use the decorator
pyinstruments.use_for_ivi to register the class as the default wrapper.
