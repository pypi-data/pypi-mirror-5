=== About ===

Medussa is an easy to use high-level cross-platform audio library for Python 
based on Port Audio and libsndfile. You can play NumPy arrays, stream sound
files of various formats from disk, or create pure tones or 'on-line' white 
or pink noise. There are high-level functions like play_array (similar to 
matlab's wavplay). Or you can access specific host api's or devices, create 
streams as needed, and control them all asynchronously. Or for the most 
control, you can access the port audio library directly. Sweet!
