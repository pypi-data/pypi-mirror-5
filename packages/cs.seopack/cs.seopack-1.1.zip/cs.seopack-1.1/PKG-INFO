Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product adds some viewlet to improve SEO in Plone sites:
        
         - Meta tag to tell robots "noindex, follow" the batch pages
        
         - Canonical url link for all pages. We have followed these rules for canonical urls:
        
            - For normal content, the url is the object's url without the trailing '/':
        
                - yoursite.com/news/ -> yoursite.com/news
        
            - Default page (and its trailing '/') is removed from the canonical url:
        
                - yoursite.com/news/aggregator -> yoursite.com/news (aggregator is the default page of news)
                - yoursite.com/news/aggregator/ -> yoursite.com/news (aggregator is the default page of news)
            
            - View or template name is preserved in the canonical url:
        
                - yoursite.com/@@search?SearchableText=query -> yoursite.com/@@search?SearchableText=query
                - yoursite.com/folder1/folder_listing -> yoursite.com/folder1/folder_listing
        
         - Customized batching template to create batching base urls based on canonical urls.
        
        Tested with Plone 4.2.x. It should work all previous Plone 4 versions, but it's untested. 
        
        In Plone 4.3.x the changes in batching template will not be available, because of the
        use of plone.batching product and this product provides replacement just for batch_macros.pt
        template.
