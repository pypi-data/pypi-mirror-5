Encoder/decoder of an UTF-7 encoded unsigned integer. Microsoft .NET Framework
uses UTF-7 unsigned integer as a length when write String with BinaryWriter.

If you have a Python server and #C clients, you may need to receive a string
object.

C#

using (MemoryBuffer buffer = new MemoryBuffer())
using (BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(buffer))
{
    writer.Write("Hello, world");
    socket.Send(buffer.ToArray(), 0, buffer.Count);
}

Python

size = utf7.unpack_socket(socket)
data = socket.recv(size)
