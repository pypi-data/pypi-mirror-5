        Introduction
        ============
        
        **xuru.recipe.android** allows you to install the android sdk as part of your parts list.
        For example::
        
            [my_android_sdk]
            recipe = xuru.recipe.android
            apis = 16 17
            system_images = intel mips
            sdk = http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.0.1-macosx.zip
            other_packages = 
                Google Play APK Expansion Library
                Google Web Driver
        
        This will install the android sdk into the parts directory, along with
        platform-tools, build-tools, and tools.  It will then install version
        16 and 17 apis.  In addition, it will install the intel and mips system images
        for each of those apis.
        
        The format of entries in the buidout section (my_android_sdk in this example)
        is::
        
            [section_name]
            recipe = xuru.recipe.android
        
        Where options are:
        
        ``apis``
            The list of api versions on one line seperated by spaces.
        
        ``system_images``
            The list of system images types for each of the apis specified above.  Valid
            values are intel, mips or arm.
        
        ``sdk``
            The full url to the downloadable zip file for the android sdk.
        
        ``install_dir``
            Optional absolute directory to install the sdk instead of the default <buidout parts
            directory>/android
        
        ``other_packages``
            Optional list (on seperate lines) of extra packages to install.  To see what
            packages there are to install type ``android list sdk -a`` on the command
            line after the sdk has been installed.  The name must be a unique sub-string
            of the names listed.
        
        Binaries Installed
        ------------------
        
        A script will be generated in the bin directory for each of the following binaries:
        - adb
        - android
        - emulator
        - uiautomationviewer
        - lint
        
        What This Does Not Install
        --------------------------
        
        If you installed the **Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM)** package, you will 
        find the installer in:
        
        ``parts/android/android-sdk-macosx/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager/IntelHAXM.dmg``
        
        This recipe will not run any installers at this time.
