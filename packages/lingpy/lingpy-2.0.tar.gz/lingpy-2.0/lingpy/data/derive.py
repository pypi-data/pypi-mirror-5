Module for the derivation of sound class models.

The module provides functions for the customized compilation of sound-class models.
All models are defined in simple text files. In order to guarantee their quick
access when loading the library, the models are compiled and stored in binary
files.

    Function compiles customized sound-class models.

    Parameters
    ----------

    model : str
        A string indicating the name of the model which shall be created.

    path : str
        A string indication the path where the model-folder is stored.

    Notes
    -----
    A model is defined by a folder placed in :file:`data/models` directory of
    the LingPy package. The name of the folder reflects the name of the model.
    It contains three files: the file :file:`converter`, the file :file:`INFO`,
    and the optional file :file:`scorer`. The format requirements for these
    files are as follows:

    :file:`INFO`
        The ``INFO``-file serves as a reference for a given sound-class model.
        It can contain arbitrary information (and also be empty). If one wants
        to define specific characteristics, like the ``source``, the
        ``compiler``, the ``date``, or a ``description`` of a given model,
        this can be done by employing a key-value structure in which the key is
        preceded by an ``@`` and followed by a colon and the value is written
        right next to the key in the same line, e.g.::
            
            @source: Dolgopolsky (1986)

        This information will then be read from the ``INFO`` file and rendered
        when printing the model to screen with help of the :py:func:`print`
        function.

    :file:`converter`
        The ``converter`` file contains all sound classes which are matched
        with their respective sound values. Each line is reserved for one
        class, precede by the key (preferably an ASCII-letter) representing the
        class::

            B : ɸ, β, f, p͡f, p͜f, ƀ
            E : ɛ, æ, ɜ, ɐ, ʌ, e, ᴇ, ə, ɘ, ɤ, è, é, ē, ě, ê, ɚ
            D : θ, ð, ŧ, þ, đ
            G : x, ɣ, χ
            ...    
    
    :file:`matrix`
        A scoring matrix indicating the alignment scores of all sound-class
        characters defined by the model. The scoring is structured as a simple
        tab-delimited text file. The first cell contains the character names,
        the following cells contain the scores in redundant form (with both
        triangles being filled):: 

            B  10.0 -10.0   5.0 ...
            E -10.0   5.0 -10.0 ...
            F   5.0 -10.0  10.0 ...
            ...

    :file:`scorer` 
        The ``scorer`` file (which is optional) contains the graph of
        class-transitions which is used for the calculation of the scoring
        dictionary. Each class is listed in a separate line, followed by the
        symbols ``v``,``c``, or ``t`` (indicating whether the class
        represents vowels, consonants, or tones), and by the classes it is
        directly connected to. The strength of this connection is indicated by
        digits (the smaller the value, the shorter the path between the
        classes)::

            A : v, E:1, O:1
            C : c, S:2
            B : c, W:2
            E : v, A:1, I:1
            D : c, S:2
            ...
        
        The information in such a file is automatically converted into a
        scoring dictionary (see :evobib:`List2012b` for details).

    Based on the information provided by the files, a dictionary for the
    conversion of IPA-characters to sound classes and a scoring dictionary are
    created and stored as a binary.  The model can be loaded with help of the
    :py:class:`~lingpy.data.model.Model` class and used in the various classes
    and functions provided by the library.

    Function compiles diacritics, vowels, and tones.

    Notes
    -----
    Diacritics and vowels are defined in the :file:`data/models/dv/` directory
    of the LingPy package and automatically loaded when loading the LingPy
    library. The values are defined as the constants
    :py:obj:`ipa_diacritics` and
    :py:obj:`ipa_vowels`. Their core purpose is to guide the
    tokenization of IPA strings (cf.
    :py:func:`~lingpy.algorithm.misc.ipa2tokens`). In order to change the
    variables, one simply has to change the text files :file:`diacritics` and
    :file:`vowels` in the :file:`data/models/dv` directory. The structure of
    these files is fairly simple: Each line contains a vowel or a diacritic
    character, whereas diacritics are preceded by a dash.
