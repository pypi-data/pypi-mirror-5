        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `strophe.pubsub.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`strophe.pubsub.js`: http://ggozad.com/strophe.plugins/docs/strophe.pubsub.html
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.strophe_pubsub``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``strophe_pubsub`` from ``js.strophe_pubsub`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.strophe_pubsub import strophe_pubsub
          >>> strophe_pubsub.need()
        
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        0.3-1 (released)
        ===============================
        
        - Switched to using: https://github.com/strophe/strophejs-plugins/blob/master/pubsub/strophe.pubsub.js instead of https://github.com/ggozad/strophe.plugins/blob/master/strophe.pubsub.js since the latter integrates with Backbone. The 'official' plugin has no version number as far as I can see, so we bring this update as a bugfix release.
        
        0.3 (released)
        ===============================
        
        - Initial release.
