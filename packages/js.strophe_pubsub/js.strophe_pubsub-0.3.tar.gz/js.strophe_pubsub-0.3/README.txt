js.strophe_pubsub
*****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `strophe.pubsub.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`strophe.pubsub.js`: http://ggozad.com/strophe.plugins/docs/strophe.pubsub.html

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.strophe_pubsub``) are published to some URL.
