Running tests
=============

django_configglue is a normal django application, so running the tests
should be as easy as running ::

	cd testproject
	PYTHONPATH=.. python manage.py test django_configglue

As a shortcut, you can also run ::

	python setup.py test

.. note:: django-configglue has only been tested with Python 2.6 but should
	work on Python 2.4+.


Getting started
===============

For documentation on django-configglue, please refer to the files found under
the ``doc`` folder.
