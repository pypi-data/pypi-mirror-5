Introduction
============

Gerbi CMS enable you to create and administrate hierarchical pages in a simple and powerful way.

Gerbi CMS is based around a placeholders concept. A placeholder is a template tag that
you can use in your page's templates. Every time you add a placeholder in your template  a field
dynamically appears in the page admin.

The project code repository is found at this address: http://github.com/batiste/django-page-cms

I recommend to `create a clone on github  <http://github.com/batiste/django-page-cms>`_ and
make modifications in your branch. Please follow those instructions:

  * Add your name to the AUTHORS file.
  * Follow the pep08, and the ~79 characters rules.
  * Add new features in the `doc/changelog.rst` file.
  * Document how the user might use a new feature.
  * If a new feature is introduced, it should have a setting disabled by default.
  * Be careful of performance regresssion.
  * Write tests for any new code.
  * Every new CMS setting should start with PAGE_<something>
  * Every new template_tag should start with pages_<something>

Test it
-------

To test this CMS checkout the code with git::

    $ git clone git://github.com/batiste/django-page-cms.git django-page-cms

Install the dependencies::

    $ sudo easy_install pip
    $ wget -c http://github.com/batiste/django-page-cms/raw/master/requirements/external_apps.txt

Gerbi CMS try to keep the code base stable. The test coverage is higher
than 80% and we try to keep it this way. To run the test suite::

    python setup.py test

.. note::

    If you are not admin you have to create the appropriate permissions to modify pages.
    After that you will be able to create pages.

Handling images and files
---------------------------

Gerbi include a image and a file placeholder for basic needs. For a more advanced
files browser you could use django-filebrowser:

  * https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-filebrowser

Once the application installed try to register the `FileBrowseInput` widget to make it
available to your placeholders.
