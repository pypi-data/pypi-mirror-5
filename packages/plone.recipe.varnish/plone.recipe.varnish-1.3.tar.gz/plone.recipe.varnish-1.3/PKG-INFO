Description: Varnish recipe for buildout
        ===========================
        
        plone.recipe.varnish is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe to install `Varnish`_. Even
        though the name contains the name Plone, there is nothing Plone specific about
        this recipe: it works for non-Zope sites just as well.
        
        Configuring it is very simple. For example::
        
            [varnish-build]
            recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
            url = ${varnish:download-url}
        
            [varnish]
            recipe = plone.recipe.varnish
            daemon = ${buildout:parts-directory}/varnish-build/sbin/varnishd
            bind = 127.0.0.1:8000
            backends = 127.0.0.1:8080
            cache-size = 256M
        
        This configures two buildout parts: ``varnish-build`` which will download,
        compile and install varnish, and ``varnish`` which runs Varnish, configured to
        listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 for requests, using a 256 megabyte cache and sending
        requests to a backend at 127.0.0.1:8080.
        
        Wrappers for all the varnish commands are created in the bin directory of your
        buildout.
        
        Please note that the configuration generated by this recipe requires Varnish
        2.0.3 or later. The ``download-url`` provided by the recipe points to the
        latest tested Varnish release compatible with the generated configuration.
        
        
        Virtual hosting
        ---------------
        
        Varnish supports virtual hosting by selecting a different backend server
        based on headers on the incoming request. You can configure the backends
        through the backends option::
        
          [varnish-instance]
          backends =
             plone.org:127.0.0.1:8000
             plone.net:127.0.0.1:9000
        
        This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic for the plone.org
        host to a backend server running on port 8000 while all traffic for the
        plone.net host is send to port 9000.
        
        
        Zope 2 hosting (with Virtual Host Monster)
        ------------------------------------------
        
        If you are using Zope 2 as backend server you will need to rewrite the URL
        so the Zope Virtual Host Monster (VHM) can generate correct links for links in
        your pages. This can be done either by a web server such as Apache or nginx
        (placed either in front or behind Varnish) but can also be done by Varnish itself.
        
        The three options are described below.
        
        Option 1 (rewrites after Varnish)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If generating these VHM-style URLs in a proxy *behind* Varnish (or if using
        VHM's 'mapping' feature), no extra Varnish configuration is needed.
        Just make sure the "backends" option directs the traffic to the proxy.
        
        Option 2 (rewrites before Varnish)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If generating these VHM-style URLs in a proxy *in-front* of Varnish, no extra
        Varnish configuration is needed as long as the original hostname is still retained
        in the URL. If the hostname is not retained, you can tell Varnish to direct requests
        based on the "path" instead of the hostname.  For example::
        
          [varnish-instance]
          backends =
            /VirtualHostBase/http/plone.org:80/Plone:127.0.0.1:8000
            /VirtualHostBase/http/plone.net:80/Plone:127.0.0.1:9000
        
        This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic for any request whose
        path starts with "/VirtualHostBase/http/plone.org:80/Plone" to a backend server
        running at 127.0.0.1 on port 8000, while request paths starting with
        "/VirtualHostBase/http/plone.net:80/Plone" are sent to port 9000.
        
        Option 3 (rewrites within Varnish)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To have Varnish generate these VHM-style URLs, you can use the **zope2_vhm_map** option.
        Here is an example::
        
          [varnish-instance]
          zope2_vhm_map =
              plone.org:/plone
              plone.net:/plone
        
        This tells us that the domain plone.org should be mapped to the location
        /plone in the backend. By combining this with the information from the
        **backends** option a varnish configuration will be generated that
        maps URLs correctly.
        
        Load Balancing
        --------------
        
        Varnish supports load balancing by configuring a director for a pool of backends.
        This director sends the incoming requests that cannot be fulfulled by varnish to
        backends in the pool in either random or round robin fashion. You can configure
        the director via the balancer option::
        
          [varnish-instance]
          balancer = random
        
        This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic to the director,
        which will choose a 'random' backend server to fulfill the request if the
        content requested is not cached by varnish itself.
        
        
        plone.recipe.varnish reference
        ------------------------------
        
        The plone.recipe.varnish recipe create a Varnish configuration file and creates
        a wrapper script inside your buildout that will start Varnish with the correct
        configuration.
        
        Please note that the configuration generated by this recipe requires Varnish
        2.0.3 or later.
        
        Please note that in order to use this recipe with varnish >= 3.0,
        varnish_version option must be set to 3
        
        It can be configured with any of these options:
        
        varnish_version
            Varnish target version. Default is ``2``.
        
        daemon
            The path of the varnish daemon to use. Set this to the ``sbin/varnishd``
            executable created by the ``zc.recipe.cmmi`` build.
        
        mode
            Specify whether the varnish daemon should run in 'daemon' or
            'foreground' mode.  The latter is useful when varnish is run by service
            supervision tools like daemontools or runit. Defaults to 'daemon'.
        
        cache-type
        
            Specify the type of cache storage to use with Varnish.  Possible values: 
            **file** (storage for each object is allocated from an arena backed by a file),
            **malloc** (storage for each object is allocated with malloc; in memory),
            or **persistent** (experimental as at Varnish 2.1.4). Defaults to 'file'.
        
        cache-location
        
            Customise the location for the Varnish file storage.  Option only applicable 
            when used with **file** or **persistent** cache-type options.  Defaults to 
            using a file named ``storage`` inside the relevant parts directory 
            (eg ``parts/varnish/storage``).  Changing the default location can be
            useful in putting the storage somewhere with quicker read speeds (RAM
            disk etc).
        
        cache-size
            The size of the cache (limited to 2G on 32bit systems). Defaults to
            256M.
        
        bind
            Hostname and port on which Varnish will listen for requests. Defaults
            to 127.0.0.1:8000.
        
        config
            Path for a Varnish VCL configuration to use. If you use this option
            you can not use the backends, zope2_vhm_map or verbose-headers options .
        
        backends
            Specifies the backend or backends which will process the (uncached)
            requests. The syntax for backends:
        
            [<hostname>][/<path>]:<ip address>:<port>
        
            The optional 'hostname' and 'path' allows you to do virtual hosting.
            If multiple backends are specified then each backend must include
            either a hostname or path (or both) so that Varnish can direct the
            matching request to the appropriate backend. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:8080.
            
        purge-hosts
            Specifies hostnames or ip addresses for purge acl. By default localhost and
            the backends are allowed to purge. Additional allowed hosts are listed here.
        
        name
            If specified this sets the name of the varnish instance (defaults to
            the host name).
        
            From varnishd's manpage:
        
              Amongst other things, this name is used to construct the name of the
              directory in which varnishd keeps temporary files and persistent state.
              If the specified name begins with a forward slash, it is interpreted as
              the absolute path to the directory which should be used for this purpose.
        
        zope2_vhm_map
            Defines a virtual host mapping for Zope servers. This is a list of
            **hostname:ZODB location** entries which specify the location inside
            Zope where the website for a virtual host lives.
        
        verbose-headers
            Varnish VCL configuration: a http-response header line  **X-Varnish-Action**
            is set for debugging purposes. It shows a hit, why it bypass/fetch from
            backend and if if the object was inserted into cache.
            Possible values: **on** or **off** (default).
        
        telnet
            If specified sets the hostname and port on which Varnish will listen
            for commands using its telnet interface.
        
        user
            The name of the user varnish should switch to before accepting any
            requests. Defaults to nobody.
        
        group
            The name of the group varnish should switch to before accepting any
            request. This defaults to the main group for the specified user.
        
        balancer
            If included and set to either 'random' or 'round-robin', this option
            configures varnish to load balance the servers specified by the 'backends'
            directive. Possible values: **none** (default), **round-robin** or
            **random**.
        
        connect-timeout
            If specified, this option configures the connection timeout (in seconds)
            for Varnish connecting to a backend server. Varnish will only try to
            connect to a given backend for this many seconds before giving up. Defaults
            to 0.4s, as per Varnish's default settings.
        
        first-byte-timeout
            If specified, this option configures the timeout (in seconds) for Varnish
            receiving the first byte from a backend. Varnish will only wait for this
            many seconds before giving up. A value of 0s means Varnish will never time
            out. Defaults to 300s, see
            http://vincentfretin.ecreall.com/articles/varnish-guru-meditation-on-timeout
        
        between-bytes-timeout
            If specified, this option configures the timeout (in seconds) for Varnish
            waiting between bytes when receiving data from a backend. Varnish will only
            wait this many seconds between bytes before giving up. A value of 0s means
            this will never time out. Defaults to 60s, as per Varnish's default
            settings.
        
        runtime-parameters
            Runtime parameter configuration options. The full list of available options
            can be found in the manpage varnishd(1) for your version of varnish.
            Examples include 'thread_pool_max', 'thread_pool_min', 'sess_timeout'.
        
        vcl_recv, vcl_hit, vcl_miss, vcl_fetch, vcl_deliver, vcl_pipe
            Insert arbitrary vcl into the generated config.

          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0 (2009-08-27)
        ----------------
        
        * Made the vcl template build its acl purge section. At present, the vcl will
          only allow purges coming from the local host. If we have multiple hosts that
          are separate from localhost, any PURGE requests will be denied without this.
          See http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/wiki/VCLExamplePurging
          [rockdj]
        
        * Added ability to set various Varnish timeouts (connect_timeout,
          first_byte_timeout, and between_bytes_timeout) from each option in the
          buildout. Default values are set at Varnish defaults of 0.4s for
          connect_timeout, and 60s for between_bytes_timeout. Time for
          first_byte_timeout is set at 300s as per plone.recipe.varnish 1.0rc9.
          [rockdj]
        
        * Set `req.http.host` for incoming virtual hosted URLs. Without setting this,
          purge requests sent from hosts other than localhost (the only host in the acl
          purge list) will result in a 404 message. See
          http://davidjb.com/blog/2009/01/plone-varnish-configuration-cache-hits-purge-fails
          [rockdj]
        
        
        1.0rc11 (2009-06-27)
        --------------------
        
        * Reintroduced grace options. What the varnish documentation say about grace:
          "varnish serves stale (but cacheable) objects while retrieving object from
          backend". The problem is "default_ttl" value is 120s (see
          bin/varnishd/mgt_param.c in varnish 2.0.4). Added a special rule for
          createObject url to not look up in the cache.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.0rc10 (2009-06-26)
        --------------------
        
        * 1.0rc9 generated broken configuration with balancer=none
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.0rc9 (2009-06-25)
        -------------------
        
        * Do not set req.grace and obj.grace. See
          http://vincentfretin.ecreall.com/articles/varnish-user-be-careful
          [vincentfretin, maurits]
        
        * Removed `header_hit_deliver` and `header_hit_notcacheable` debug messages
          from default template. It is not safe to assign to the object during
          `vcl_hit` until http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/ticket/310 is not fixed.
          See also http://kristian.blog.linpro.no/2009/05/25/common-varnish-issues.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Updated to refer to Varnish 2.0.4. Added a `first_byte_timeout` value of
          300 seconds to the backend definitions. This is a new option since Varnish
          2.0.3 and by default set to 60 seconds. This is arguably too low for certain
          edit operations in Plone sites.

        1.0rc8 (2008-02-12)
        -------------------
        
        * Remove the custom vcl_hash from the template. Adding the Accept-Encoding
          header to the cache break effectively breaks purging since nobody will
          ever include those headers in a PURGE request. To make this safe we just
          remove the Accept-Encoding header from all incoming requests as well.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0rc7 (2008-11-26)
        -------------------
        
        * Be more explicit about deprecating the :build entry point.
          [wichert]
        
        * Make the :instance specifier optional: after :build has been removed
          we can deprecate :instance as well.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0rc6 (2008-09-22)
        -------------------
        
        * Deprecate plone.recipe.varnish:build in favour of zc.recipe.cmmi: it does
          not make sense to duplicate its logic here.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add feature to enable verbose headers in varnish.vcl. This is primary
          interesting for debugging of cache-settings. See README.txt.
          [jensens]
        
        * Deal better with sources which do not have executable-bits set or
          are svn exports.
          [wichert]
        
        * The 1.0rc5 release was broken and has been retracted. Currently the trunk
          is only usable with the Varnish 2.0-beta1 and later.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0rc5 (2008-04-27)
        -------------------
        
        * Pipe is evil: it pipes the whole connection to the backend which means
          varnish will no longer process any further requests if HTTP pipelining is
          used. Switch to using pass instead.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add a default_ttl of zero seconds to the Varnish runner to avoid a Varnish
          bug with the handling of an Expires header with a date in the past.
          [newbery]
        
        * Merged branches/newbery-hostnamepath.
          [newbery]
        
        * We don't need to include Accept-Encoding in the hash. Varnish takes care
          of Vary negotiation already.
          [newbery]
        
        
        1.0rc4 (2008-03-18)
        -------------------
        
        * Fixed typos / whitespace.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Varnish 1.1.2 is out.
          [wichert]
        
        * Merged witsch-foreground-support back to trunk.
          [witsch]
        
        * Use a pidfile.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0rc3 (2007-09-02)
        -------------------
        
        * Fixed a bug where options["location"] was being used before it was being set.
          [rocky]
        
        * Made the module name determination a little more robust during
          createVarnishConfig so that recipes that specify version deps still work.
          [rocky]
        
        * Do not use defaults for user and group.
          [wichert]
        
        * We do need the parts: we use it for the file storage.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0rc2 (2007-08-29)
        -------------------
        
        * Add an option to use an existing configuration file.
          [wichert]
        
        * Remove hardcoded caching for images, binaries, CSS and javascript. This
          should be done by the backend server or a custom varnish configuration.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add Accept-Encoding to the cache key so we can handle compressed content.
          [wichert]
        
        * Test if a bin-directory exists. This allows us to compile varnish 1.0
          which does not have an sbin directory.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0rc1 (2007-08-27)
        -------------------
        
        * Document the OSX bugfix we apply when building varnish.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add a dummy update method to prevent needless recompiles.
          [wichert]
        
        * Update for Varnish 1.1.1.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0b2 (2007-08-25)
        ------------------
        
        * When building from svn, we need to run autogen.sh.
          [optilude]
        
        * Refactor the recipe: there are now separate recipes to build and configure
          Varnish. This makes it possible to reconfigure varnish without having to
          recompile with as well as using an already installed varnish.
          [wichert]
        
        * Move the OSX patching code into a separate method.
          [wichert]
        
        * Use pass for non-GET/HEAD requests. This makes a bit more sense and fixes a
          login problem for Plone sites.
          [wichert]
        
        * Reorganize a bit for readability.
          [wichert]
        
        * Support Python 2.3 as well.
          [wichert]
        
        * Make it possible to specify the user and group as well.
          [wichert]
        
        * Do not create the source directory - we move the extracted source in its
          place later.
          [wichert]
        
        * If running on OS X, patch libtool as described in
          http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/ticket/118 and
          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.varnish.misc/668/focus=669.
          [optilude]
        
        * VCL is not C. You need the curlies even on single-line if statements.
          [optilude]
        
        * This rewriting style only works on Zope 3 - Zope 3 reinvented that wheel.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add support for If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match requests.
          Thanks to newbery for the suggstions.
          [wichert]
        
        * Explicitly mention that there is nothing Plone or Zope specific about
          this recipe.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0b1 (2007-08-04)
        ------------------
        
        * More documentation.
          [wichert]
        
        * Ignore the port information in the host header.
          [wichert]
        
        * Use the port varnish is bound to in the VHM mapping.
          [wichert]
        
        * Define all default values centrally.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add support for Zope virtual hosts.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add support for virtual hosting.
          [wichert]
        
        * Initial import of Varnish recipe.
