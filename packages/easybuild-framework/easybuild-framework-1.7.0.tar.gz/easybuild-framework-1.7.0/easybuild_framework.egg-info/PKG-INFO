        EasyBuild: building software with ease
        --------------------------------------
        
        The easybuild-framework package is the basis for EasyBuild
        (http://hpcugent.github.com/easybuild), a software build and
        installation framework written in Python that allows you to install
        software in a structured, repeatable and robust way.
        
        This package contains the EasyBuild framework that supports the
        implementation and use of so-called easyblocks, that implement the
        software install procedure for a particular (group of) software
        package(s).
        
        The code of the easybuild-framework package is hosted on GitHub, along
        with an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests, see
        http://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework.
        
        The EasyBuild documentation is available on the GitHub wiki of the
        easybuild meta-package, see
        http://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Home.

        which build options; these easyconfigs will be well tested with the
        latest compatible versions of the easybuild-framework and
        easybuild-easyblocks packages.
