=========

KingSnake is a Python implementation of chess for two human players. Because
players are also objects, an AI implementation would also be possible.

KingSnake checks each move for legality and only allows legal moves to occur.
However, because the library is open, you of course also have the possibility
to move pieces around manually without invoking moves, making it possible to
set up historical chess games and revel in the past.

This software is released under the GNU General Public License, so feel free to
use it any way you like.
