KingSnake
=========

KingSnake is a Python implementation of chess for two human players. Because
players are also objects, an AI implementation would also be possible.

A simple text-based chess game can be started with the script `kingsnake`. This
script calls `KingSnake.py` in xterm with a large font. If you don't want to use
the xterm terminal, you can call `KingSnake.py` directly.

KingSnake checks each move for legality and only allows legal moves to occur.
However, because the library is open, you of course also have the possibility
to move pieces around manually without invoking moves, making it possible to
set up historical chess games and revel in the past.

use it any way you like.
