        Installation
        ============
        
        To install raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg into your Plone instance, locate the file
        buildout.cfg in the root of your Plone instance directory on the file system,
        and open it in a text editor.
        
        Add the actual raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg add-on to the "eggs" section of
        buildout.cfg. Look for the section that looks like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
        
        This section might have additional lines if you have other add-ons already
        installed. Just add the raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg on a separate line, like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg
        
        Note that you have to run buildout like this::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Then go to the "Add-ons" control panel in Plone as an administrator, and
        install or reinstall the "raptus.article.default" product.
        
        Note that if you do not use the raptus.article.default package you have to
        include the zcml of raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg either by adding it
        to the zcml list in your buildout or by including it in another package's
        configure.zcml.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Add/Edit your article
        ---------------------
        If you add or edit an article you get a new rich text field called additional text.
        Insert the text you would like to have displayed by the additional wysiwyg component
        and press save.
        
        Components
        ----------
        Navigate to the "Components" tab of your article and select one of the additional
        wysiwyg components and press "save and view".
