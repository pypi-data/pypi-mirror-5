=============================
  colorunit: A nose plugin
=============================

Why?
====

Why do I write this plugin for nose ,The reason is so
sample that the nose original report is so ugly, what's the worse, not
friendly for tester, actually python tester.


How?
====

How to use this nose plugin: colorunit, Only tree steps you need to follow:


Install colorunit:
------------------

1.1) Install with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::            

     pip install nose-colorxunit

1.2ï¼‰Uninstall with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip uninstall nose-colorxunit

2.1) Install with source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, active your own python virtual environment if you have.

Then on the terminal type::
    
     python setup.py build

     python setup.py install

If you just want to install it as a super user or using sudo command, please think it again.

2.2) Uninstall with source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just go to your own python virtual environment site-packages
directory, and find nose_colorxunit-..-py..egg, then delete it.


Register colorunit [Optional]
-----------------------------

Now this is optional, just write the following code snippet into Any
one of your test files if you like, for example, test_demo.py.::

    import nose 
    from colorunit import ColorUnit 
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        nose.main(addplugins=[ColorUnit()])


Run the test files
------------------

::

     nosetests --with-colorunit

.. note::

    Without --with-colorunit, the output will be the original report!

    Be sure that you are working in your own python virtual environment
