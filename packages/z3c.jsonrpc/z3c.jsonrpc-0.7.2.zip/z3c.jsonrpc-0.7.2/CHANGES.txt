0.7.2 (2013-10-11)
------------------

- ``handleException``: provide human readable traceback


0.7.1 (2012-11-27)
------------------

- Fix ``JSONRPCTestTransport`` to include the request full host.
  Until now it ate the port.


0.7.0 (2012-03-25)
------------------

- Fix: added missing exception import for ParseError in publisher.processInputs

- import doctest from python


0.6.0 (2010-01-27)
------------------

- cleanup setup dependencies, adjust ftesting.zcml

- adjust coverage report setup

- implemented error view concept which will work with ZopePublication

- implemented default error view for known zope and JSON-RPC errors

- use DirectResult in response

- removed unauthenticated error view. This was not working and requires a
  custom concept supported by the used java script library used at client
  side


Version 0.5.4 (2009-04-07)
--------------------------

- handle empty and none-existing params in jsonrpc requests


Version 0.5.3 (2009-03-10)
--------------------------

- Fix: reflect skin lookup changes in zope.publisher. Use the new skinnable
  concept.

- Fix: The default skin didn't get applied based on the inherited concept give
  from the zope.publisher.browser implementation because our JSON-RPC request
  doesn't provide IBrowserRequest. Added a workaround which will apply a given
  IDefaultSkin during request instance creation.


Version 0.5.2 (2009-02-24)
--------------------------

- added tests for all JSON-RPC versions

- Feature: implemented defaultJSONRPCSkin directive

- Feature: support non positional arguments for all jsonrpc versions. There is
  now no distinction in handling method parameters for all supported versions.

- Fix: for jsonrpc version 1.1 :
   - must not provide "error" property in case of success
   - must not provide "result" property in case of error

- Fix: removed develop path for z3c.json from buildout.cfg

- Fix: publisher checks for version id as a string not a float

- Feature: Implemented JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. Use JSON-RPC 2.0 version as
  default. Optional the version 1.0 and 1.1 can be set. See JSON-RPC 2.0
  specification for more information.

- Feature: Added initial version of JSON-RPC exceptions.

- Added explicit test cleanup since some zope testing change left over a
  global adapter registry from old connections

- Removed unused dependency to z3c.layer in test setup

- Removed unused dependency on z3c.i18n.


Version 0.5.1 (2008-01-24)
--------------------------

- Improve meta-data.

- Bug: The skin code relied on un-released API that was actually later
  reverted.
