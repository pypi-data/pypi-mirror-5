Description: 
            Katapayadi sankhya is a simplification of Aryabhata's
            Sanskrit numerals, due probably to Haridatta from Kerala.
            In Malayalam it is also known as 'Paralperu'
            For eg: ചണ്ഡാംശുചന്ദ്രാധമകുംഭിപാല represents 31415926536 which
            is π*1000000000000000
            More examples in Malayalam are given in this page
