Description: Finch CMS
        =========
        
        Finch CMS is a simple to use but flexible CMS for django. It is also
        very simple to install and integrate into your django project.
        
        First make sure you have a django project, preferably in a virtual
        environment. If you need help with that, check out the django
        tutorial_.
        
        To install the latest version from pypi::
        
          $ pip install finch-cms
        
          ...
        
        Edit settings.py. The easiest option is to include the following lines
        at the bottom::
        
          from finch import monkeypatch_settings
          monkeypatch_settings(locals())
        
        If you prefer to update the settings manually look at
        finch.project_settings and the monkeypatch_settings function
        (finch/__init__.py).
        
        Also add the following in your urls.py::
        
        
          urlpatterns = patterns(
              ...
              url(r'^finch/', include('finch.urls')),
          )
        
        Finally run the following commands::
        
          $ ./manage.py syncdb
          $ ./manage.py make_homepage
          $ ./manage.py runserver
