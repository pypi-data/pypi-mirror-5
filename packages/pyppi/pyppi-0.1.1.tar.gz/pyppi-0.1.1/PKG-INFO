        PyPPI (Python Private Package Index) is a Django application that provides a private
        `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
        Originally forked from the DjangoPyPi  project, this project gets ideas and code from
        chishop and DjangoPyPi2.
        
        The reason of this project is that in big environment we need features not provided by the orginal packages:
        
        * Ability to allow/deny package registration
        * Ability to allow/deny package distribution upload
        * Different levels of visibility and access to the packages
        * Create Teams with proper access level
