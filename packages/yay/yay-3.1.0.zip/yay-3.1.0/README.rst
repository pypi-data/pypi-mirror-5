Yay is a non-strict lazily evaluated configuration language. It combines
YAML-like data declarations with lazy python expressions. We really hope you
like this, please let us know if it's useful.

It works with python 2.6+, 3.2+ and pypy 1.9.

Yay is very new software, and although we have tested it a lot it is
certainly full of bugs. Please subscribe to the yaybu-dev mailing list, which
you can find on http://lists.yaybu.com.

All documentation can be found at http://yay.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ which
includes a tour of the language and an explanation of the grammar.

If you are interested in this project, you should probably check out Yaybu,
which uses Yay to drive a complete system deployment and management system.
You can find Yaybu at http://yaybu.com.
