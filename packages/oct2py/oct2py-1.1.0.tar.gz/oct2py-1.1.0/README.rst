Oct2py is a means to seemlessly call m-files and Octave functions from python.
It manages the Octave session for you, sharing data behind the scenes using
MAT files.  Usage is as simple as:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> oc = oct2py.Oct2Py() 
    >>> x = oc.zeros(3,3)
    >>> print x, x.dtype
    [[ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]] float64
    ...

If you want to run legacy m-files, do not have MATLABÂ®, and do not fully
trust a code translator, this is your library.  


Features
--------

- Supports all Octave datatypes and most python datatypes and numpy dtypes.
- Provides %octavemagic% for IPython, including inline plotting in notebooks.
- Supports cell arrays and structs with arbitrary nesting.
- Supports sparse matrices.
- Builds methods on the fly linked to Octave commands (e.g. `zeros` above).
- Nargout is automatically inferred by the number of return variables.
- Thread-safety: each Oct2Py object uses an independent Octave session.
- Can be used as a context manager.
- Supports unicode characters.


Installation
------------
You must have GNU Octave installed and in your PATH. On Windows, the easiest
way to get Octave is to use an installer from SourceForge_.
On Linux, it should be available from your package manager.
Additionally, you must have the numpy and scipy libraries installed.

To install Oct2py, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install oct2py

Or, if you absolutely must:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ easy_install oct2py
