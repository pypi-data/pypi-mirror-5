A Python module that implements the Picture Transfer Protocol, including
support for CHDK extensions.

Installation
============

1. Make sure that

   * a C compiler is installed
   * the C header files of libusb and Python itself are installed.
     Under Ubuntu and Debian, these are the packages libusb-dev
     and python-dev.
   * Install libtool and automake.
   * To run tests, you need Python's testtols package. (python-testtools
     in Ubuntu and Debian.)

2. Install the right version of libptp

python-chdk-ptp requires yet another special libptp version:
https://launchpad.net/python-ptp-chdk/trunk/0.1/+download/libptp-chdk-patches-0.1.tar.gz

Unpack the libptp source code into the subdirectory 'libptp' of the main
python-chdsk-ptp source code directory and run

  cd libptp
  autogen.sh
  configure --with-pic
  make

3. Build and install python-ptp-chdk

Run (in the main source code directory)

  setup.py build
  setup.py install

Usage
=====

See examples and tests. (Note that some examples require the Python
Imaging Library.)

This project would be completely pointless without the amazing work
done by the CHDK developers anaylzing and extending the firmware of
Canon compact cameras. Parts of the source code is borrowed from
http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/chdkde/trunk/ and
